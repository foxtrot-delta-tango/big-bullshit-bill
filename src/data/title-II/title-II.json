    "impact": "Will meaningfully improve safety and habitability of troop housing, a chronic readiness issue corroborated by GAO inspections. However, relying on privatized projects raises familiar risks—opaque landlord accounting, uneven maintenance and weak enforcement of punch-list items. Tight construction labor markets and environmental remediation could delay Barracks 2030 timelines andinflate costs. Congress may scrutinize whether new allowances simply track local-market rent inflation without net purchasing-power gains.",
