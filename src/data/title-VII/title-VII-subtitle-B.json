    "sectionTitle": "Review of Agency Rulemaking",
    "summary": "Appropriates $100 million (available through FY 2028) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new deregulation initiative administered by the Office of Information & Regulatory Affairs (OIRA).  Funds may be used only to strengthen regulatory analysis, streamline OMB‑level review procedures, and scrutinize rules issued by seven “covered agencies” (Education, Energy, HHS, DHS, DOJ, CFPB, and EPA).  The Social Security Administration is expressly excluded.  The section borrows the Administrative Procedure Act definition of a “rule,” but limits its application to rules from those covered agencies.",
    "impact": "• **Expanded OIRA bandwidth.** Doubling OIRA’s effective resources with a one‑time $100 million infusion could markedly increase staff, contractor support, and data‑science capacity—yielding more exhaustive cost‑benefit reviews and potential delays for high‑impact rules.\n• **Stronger deregulatory leverage.** Concentrating new analytic firepower on environmental, consumer‑finance, health, and homeland‑security regulations may facilitate stricter cost‑benefit thresholds or rescissions reminiscent of prior deregulatory campaigns.\n• **Policy uncertainty for regulated entities.** Deeper, lengthier reviews may slow final rule publication, prompting businesses to hedge compliance investments; conversely, a more robust analytical record could reduce litigation risk once rules are finalized.\n• **Targeted scope.** By omitting SSA and independent commissions (e.g., SEC, FCC), the initiative focuses on executive agencies already subject to presidential oversight, leaving finance‑market and communications rules largely untouched.",
