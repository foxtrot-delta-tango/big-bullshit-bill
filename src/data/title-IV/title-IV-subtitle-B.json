    "summary": "Eliminates the Inflation Reduction Act’s $1 billion rebate/grant program that was about to fund the purchase of zero-emission school buses, garbage trucks, and port-drayage rigs and to cover related charging or hydrogen infrastructure.  All unobligated funds are clawed back.",
    "impact": [
      "Eliminates a still-growing $1 billion program that focused on the dirtiest vehicles on U.S. roads. Class 6–8 trucks log only about 6 % of all vehicle-miles but pump out more than 55 % of on-road NOx and PM-2.5. EPA modeling showed that, once the first fleet tranche rolled out, the incentive would avert roughly 700 000 tons of CO₂, 4 000 tons of NOx, and 200 tons of PM each year. Demand was strong: the 2024 inaugural round drew pre-applications from more than 2 100 school districts, transit agencies, and drayage operators—five times the money on offer. Without the grant, those entities must pivot to much smaller, oversubscribed pots (DERA, BIL Clean School Bus) or settle for new diesel rigs. Manufacturers such as Blue Bird, Lion Electric, and Nikola had already expanded lines and supply deals on the assumption of stable federal orders through 2031, so the abrupt repeal guts their backlogs, chills new battery-plant plans, and stalls the volume-driven price declines the sector needs.",
      "Fiscal gains are negligible next to the lost health and climate benefits. Scrapping the unobligated balance shaves barely 0.02 % from ten-year discretionary spending, yet the EPA had pegged avoided asthma attacks and hospital stays at up to $6 billion in savings over the same window. The agency must now unwind open solicitations and pull back tentative awards; buyers that have already placed orders may sue for reliance damages. Section 132 of the Inflation Reduction Act also earmarked at least 40 % of funds for disadvantaged communities, so cancellation risks widening pollution gaps along urban freight corridors. Bottom line: the move slows heavy-duty electrification, shifts costs back to local governments, and clouds the business case for U.S. e-truck manufacturing while offering only token deficit relief."
