    "sectionText": "SEC. 43101. IDENTIFICATION AND AUCTION OF SPECTRUM.\r\n\r\n    (a) Identification.--\r\n            (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \r\n        the enactment of this Act, the Assistant Secretary and the \r\n        Commission shall identify, from spectrum in the covered band \r\n        that is allocated for Federal use, non-Federal use, or shared \r\n        Federal and non-Federal use, a total of not less than 600 \r\n        megahertz of spectrum for reallocation for non-Federal use on \r\n        an exclusive, licensed basis for mobile broadband services, \r\n        fixed broadband services, mobile and fixed broadband services, \r\n        or a combination thereof.\r\n            (2) Withdrawal or modification of federal government \r\n        assignments.--The President, acting through the Assistant \r\n        Secretary, shall--\r\n                    (A) withdraw or modify the assignments to Federal \r\n                Government stations of spectrum identified under \r\n                paragraph (1) as necessary for the Commission to comply \r\n                with subsection (b); and\r\n                    (B) not later than 30 days after completing any \r\n                necessary withdrawal or modification under subparagraph \r\n                (A), notify the Commission that the withdrawal or \r\n                modification is complete.\r\n            (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection may \r\n        be construed to change the respective authorities of the \r\n        Assistant Secretary and the Commission with respect to spectrum \r\n        allocated for Federal use, non-Federal use, or shared Federal \r\n        and non-Federal use.\r\n    (b) Auction.--\r\n            (1) In general.--The Commission shall, through 1 or more \r\n        systems of competitive bidding under section 309(j) of the \r\n        Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)), grant licenses \r\n        for the use of the spectrum identified under subsection (a) on \r\n        an exclusive, licensed basis for mobile broadband services, \r\n        fixed broadband services, mobile and fixed broadband services, \r\n        or a combination thereof.\r\n            (2) Schedule.--Notwithstanding paragraph (15)(A) of section \r\n        309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)), \r\n        the Commission shall auction spectrum under paragraph (1) of \r\n        this subsection according to the following schedule:\r\n                    (A) Not later than 3 years after the date of the \r\n                enactment of this Act, the Commission shall complete 1 \r\n                or more systems of competitive bidding for not less \r\n                than 200 megahertz of such spectrum.\r\n                    (B) Not later than 6 years after the date of the \r\n                enactment of this Act, the Commission shall complete 1 \r\n                or more systems of competitive bidding for any \r\n                remaining spectrum required to be auctioned under \r\n                paragraph (1) after compliance with subparagraph (A) of \r\n                this paragraph.\r\n    (c) Auction Proceeds to Cover 110 Percent of Federal Relocation or \r\nSharing Costs.--Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve the \r\nCommission from the requirements of section 309(j)(16)(B) of the \r\nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(16)(B)).\r\n    (d) Auction Authority.--Section 309(j)(11) of the Communications \r\nAct of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(11)) is amended by striking ``grant a \r\nlicense or permit under this subsection shall expire March 9, 2023'' \r\nand all that follows and inserting ``complete a system of competitive \r\nbidding under this subsection shall expire September 30, 2034.''.\r\n    (e) Definitions.--In this section:\r\n            (1) Assistant secretary.--The term ``Assistant Secretary'' \r\n        means the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications \r\n        and Information.\r\n            (2) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal \r\n        Communications Commission.\r\n            (3) Covered band.--\r\n                    (A) In general.--The term ``covered band'' means \r\n                the band of frequencies between 1.3 gigahertz and 10 \r\n                gigahertz, inclusive.\r\n                    (B) Exclusion.--The term ``covered band'' does not \r\n                include the following:\r\n                            (i) The band of frequencies between 3.1 \r\n                        gigahertz and 3.45 gigahertz, inclusive.\r\n                            (ii) The band of frequencies between 5.925 \r\n                        gigahertz and 7.125 gigahertz, inclusive.",
    "summary": "Directs NTIA (through the Assistant Secretary) and the FCC to clear and repurpose at least 600 MHz of mid-band spectrum (1.3 GHz–10 GHz, excluding 3.1–3.45 GHz and 5.925–7.125 GHz) for exclusive, licensed commercial broadband use. The FCC must auction at least 200 MHz within three years and the remainder within six years; proceeds must still cover 110 percent of Federal relocation costs. The bill also re-authorizes the FCC’s spectrum-auction authority through September 30 2034.",
    "impact": "•  Accelerates a new ‘spectrum pipeline’ for 5G/6G, boosting capacity for mobile operators and generating tens of billions in auction revenue.  \n•  Puts pressure on DoD, NOAA, and other incumbents to vacate or share heavily used government bands—likely triggering costly relocation studies and potential mission-impact debates.  \n•  Long-term extension of auction authority gives industry certainty but may draw scrutiny over how quickly the 6 GHz and 7–8 GHz bands can be cleared versus expanded unlicensed use.",

    "summary": "Appropriates $500 million (FY 2025–2034) for the U.S. Department of Commerce to replace legacy systems with commercial AI, automate operations, and harden cybersecurity. It simultaneously enacts a 10-year Federal pre-emption that bars states or localities from imposing substantive design, performance, data-handling, liability, or fee requirements on AI or automated-decision systems in interstate commerce, except for narrowly defined facilitative laws or criminal statutes.",
    "impact": "•  Funds long-desired IT upgrades at agencies like NTIA, NOAA, USPTO, and Census—potentially improving service delivery and threat detection.  \n•  Nationwide moratorium overrides the patchwork of emerging state AI regulations (e.g., California, Colorado) for a decade, centralizing rule-making power in Washington and offering industry one set of standards—but provoking concerns from consumer-protection and civil-rights advocates about algorithmic accountability gaps.  \n•  Could spur faster commercial AI adoption by reducing compliance friction, yet may trigger constitutional challenges over states’ rights and public-safety carve-outs.",
