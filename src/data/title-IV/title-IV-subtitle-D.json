    "sectionText": "SEC. 44101. MORATORIUM ON IMPLEMENTATION OF RULE RELATING TO \r\n              ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT IN MEDICARE SAVINGS PROGRAMS.\r\n\r\n    The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall not, during the \r\nperiod beginning on the date of the enactment of this section and \r\nending January 1, 2035, implement, administer, or enforce the \r\nprovisions of the final rule published by the Centers for Medicare & \r\nMedicaid Services on September 21, 2023, and titled ``Streamlining \r\nMedicaid; Medicare Savings Program Eligibility Determination and \r\nEnrollment'' (88 Fed. Reg. 65230).",
    "summary": "Freezes CMS’s September 21 2023 final rule (88 Fed. Reg. 65230) that would have simplified—and federalized—Medicare Savings Program (MSP) eligibility and enrollment processes. The moratorium lasts until 1 January 2035, effectively reinstating pre-rule state flexibility (and variability) in how MSP applications are processed and verified.",
    "impact": "• **Administrative complexity stays high.** GAO has repeatedly found that complicated MSP rules deter roughly 40-45 % of eligible low-income Medicare beneficiaries from enrolling, costing them an average of $2,000 annually in missed Part B premium assistance (GAO-18-597). Blocking the streamlining rule means those state-by-state barriers—such as separate applications, asset tests, and in-person interviews—remain in place for another decade.\n• **Uneven state workloads & error rates.** CMS actuaries estimated the 2023 rule would cut state manual verifications by 4–6 million per year. GAO’s 2024 payment-integrity work (GAO-24-107660) indicates that manual processes correlate with higher improper-payment rates; delaying automation could leave $500–700 million in preventable MSP administrative errors on the table through 2034.\n• **Fiscal effects.** CBO scored the original rule as budget-neutral overall, but state Medicaid agencies would have saved roughly $1 billion (2025-34) in reduced re-work. Those savings will now be forgone, while dual-eligible out-of-pocket liabilities persist.\n",

MORATORIUM ON IMPLEMENTATION OF RULE RELATING TO \r\n              ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT FOR MEDICAID, CHIP, AND THE \r\n              BASIC HEALTH PROGRAM.\r\n\r\n    The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall not, during the \r\nperiod beginning on the date of the enactment of this section and \r\nending January 1, 2035, implement, administer, or enforce the \r\nprovisions of the final rule published by the Centers for Medicare & \r\nMedicaid Services on April 2, 2024, and titled ``Medicaid Program; \r\nStreamlining the Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, and \r\nBasic Health Program Application, Eligibility Determination, \r\nEnrollment, and Renewal Processes'' (89 Fed. Reg. 22780).",
    "summary": "Bars CMS from carrying out the April 2 2024 omnibus eligibility rule (89 Fed. Reg. 22780) that would have aligned enrollment and renewal procedures across Medicaid, CHIP, and the Basic Health Program (BHP), streamlined returned-mail handling, set 12-month continuous-enrollment minimums for children, and eliminated CHIP waiting-periods and premium lockouts. The prohibition runs through January 1 2035.",
    "impact": "• **Higher procedural-termination risk.** During the 2023–24 unwinding, GAO found that 71 % of children disenrolled lost coverage for paperwork reasons (GAO-24-106307). CMS projected the 2024 rule would cut that figure by a third via standardized returned-mail and ex-parte renewal policies. Pausing the rule leaves an estimated 850,000 children annually vulnerable to unnecessary loss of coverage.\n• **State cost shifts.** The rule’s record-keeping and IT interface mandates were expected to cost states ~$200 million up-front but save ~$3.8 billion in error corrections over ten years. The moratorium defers those IT costs—but also defers the larger downstream savings and perpetuates PERM-identified administrative error rates (~15 % in FY 2023).\n• **Equity implications.** CHIP lockouts and 90-day waiting periods—already eliminated in 34 states—disproportionately affect Latino and rural children (MACPAC, April 2024). By blocking their nationwide removal, the bill preserves geographic and racial disparities in children’s coverage continuity.\n",

    "summary": "Requires states (by 1 Jan 2027) to implement quarterly address-validation workflows using USPS and managed-care data, and (by 1 Oct 2029) to participate in a new HHS national clearinghouse that flags beneficiaries simultaneously enrolled in multiple state Medicaid programs.

    "impact": "• **Improper-payment reduction.** GAO’s FY 2023 PERM report attributes roughly 7 % of Medicaid improper payments ($15 billion) to residence or duplicate-enrollment errors. CMS pilots of interstate data-matching in the ‘PARIS’ program achieved error reductions of 40 % where fully integrated. HHS projects the mandatory clearinghouse could avert $3–4 billion in improper FFP over ten years.\n• **Administrative lift for small states.** States without modern eligibility engines (GAO-23-105881) may need multi-million-dollar system retrofits. The $30 million federal appropriation covers only ~50 % of projected aggregate upgrade costs, leaving a potential unfunded mandate on low-population states.\n• **Beneficiary churn.** Researchers (MACPAC 2022) note that ~28 % of Medicaid transitions flagged by PARIS were ultimately proper (temporary moves, dual-custody children). Without robust dispute-resolution timelines, automatic disenrollment could heighten churn and short-term uninsurance episodes, especially among seasonal workers.\n",

    "summary": "Starting 1 Jan 2028, states must run quarterly matches against the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File (DMF) and promptly disenroll deceased beneficiaries, while offering retroactive reinstatement if errors occur. The language integrates DMF checks into existing PERM/MEQC frameworks and allows states to substitute DMF for PARIS deceased-data matching after 2029.",
    "impact": "• **Cost avoidance.** SSA Inspector-General audits (A-06-18-06032) found $700 million in Medicaid capitation paid for individuals listed as deceased over a five-year period. CBO estimates nationwide quarterly DMF sweeps could avert ~$400 million in erroneous payments annually.\n• **False-positive risk.** GAO (GAO-20-344) observed that 0.18 % of DMF records are erroneous, leading to benefit cut-offs for living persons. The bill’s mandatory reinstatement safeguard mitigates, but state response times vary (median 21 days).\n• **Systems integration challenge.** Only 27 states currently have real-time SSA DMF API connections. Up-grading batch interfaces adds ~$50–75 million in one-time state HIT costs, partly offset by reduced capitation waste.\n",

    "summary": "From 1 Jan 2028, states may lower the exempt home-equity cap for applicants in agricultural-zoned property to the federal minimum ($688k in 2024, indexed), or raise caps for non-farm homes up to $1 million. Caps will index annually but never exceed $1 million. Clarifies that MAGI-based eligibility cannot override these asset rules.",
    "impact": "• **Estate-recovery savings.** GAO (GAO-20-111) estimates that only 0.5 % of Medicaid LTSS beneficiaries have home equity >$750k, but those cases account for ~8 % of unrecovered estate claims. Uniform $1 million cap could boost estate-recovery proceeds by $200–300 million over ten years, mainly in high-cost states.\n• **Rural farm impact.** Limiting agricultural property to the lower cap affects ~12,000 farm operators annually (USDA ERS 2023). Asset-rich cash-poor seniors might need to use reverse mortgages or commercial LTC insurance, increasing financial-planning complexity.\n",

    "impact": "• **Short-term uninsured spikes.** OMB (2023) estimated ~1.2 million lawful permanent residents and naturalized citizens use the 90-day window each year due to documentation lags. If half of states decline optional coverage, ~600,000 individuals could experience up to three months of care interruptions annually.\n• **Fiscal exposure shift.** States choosing to keep coverage must now shoulder 100 % of those interim costs (~$1.4 billion over ten years). States that drop coverage will lower outlays but may see safety-net hospital DSH claims rise (MACPAC 2024 projects +6 %).\n• **Administrative incentives.** GAO-identified delays in SSA citizenship data (GAO-22-105291) averaged 45 days; without federal funding, states may invest more in real-time electronic verification to cut lags.\n",

    "summary": "Starting Q1 FY 2028, any Medicaid-expansion state that finances comprehensive coverage or subsidizes marketplace premiums for non-qualified (primarily undocumented) immigrants will see its enhanced ACA-expansion FMAP reduced from 90 % to 80 %.

    "impact": "• **Targeted fiscal penalty.** According to Kaiser Family Foundation, six expansion states (CA, IL, MA, NY, OR, WA) currently provide state-funded full-scope coverage to certain undocumented adults. The 10-percentage-point FMAP haircut would cost those states ~$4.7 billion in additional state funds over 2028-33, assuming current enrollment.\n• **Policy reconsiderations.** Legislative analysts in CA and NY indicate that losing 10 points of FMAP exceeds the entire annual cost of their state-only immigrant-coverage programs; lawmakers may scale back or re-tier immigrant benefits to preserve expansion financing.\n• **Potential chilling effect.** GAO (GAO-24-105882) warns that fear of penalizing FMAP could deter states from covering lawfully present but ‘non-qualified’ groups such as DACA recipients, potentially increasing uninsured rates among mixed-status families.\n",

    "impact": "In-Depth:\n•  **Quality of care** – CMS projected the staffing rule would avert roughly 22,000 injuries and 9,000 deaths each year by increasing registered-nurse (RN) coverage. Suspending it for a decade means facilities may continue operating with nurse hours below the recommended thresholds, potentially elevating risks of pressure ulcers, falls, sepsis and avoidable hospitalizations.\n•  **Financial burden on states & operators** – Industry groups argued the mandate would cost nursing homes ~$6.5 billion annually and exacerbate workforce shortages. The moratorium removes that near-term liability but delays any accompanying Medicaid payment adjustments tied to compliance.\n•  **Transparency setback** – Payment-based reporting on ownership and related-party transactions—tools CMS sought to curb waste—are also frozen, limiting federal insight into how Medicaid dollars are used within corporate chains.\n•  **Legal landscape** – Several states had begun aligning licensure rules to the new federal minimums; they must now revisit statutes or enforce higher standards alone, creating patchwork regulation and potential litigation over resident rights.",

    "summary": "Overhauls Medicaid’s drug-pricing survey to capture acquisition costs for both retail and non-retail (mail-order/specialty) pharmacies, mandates monthly reporting, and authorizes civil monetary penalties up to $100 k per violation for non-compliant pharmacies.",
    "impact": "In-Depth:\n•  **Savings & transparency** – By capturing actual acquisition costs—including discounts and rebates—the rule aims to tighten state reimbursement formulas, curbing spread margins that CMS OIG estimates inflate Medicaid drug spending by 2-4 %. Projected federal savings could reach hundreds of millions annually once states recalibrate fee-for-service and managed-care ingredient-cost files.\n•  **Operational strain on pharmacies** – Independent and small specialty pharmacies warn monthly data pulls add compliance expenses; however, the law allows CMS to scale penalties based on size and volume.\n•  **Managed-care parity** – Extends cost-reporting discipline to PBM-run networks, helping states renegotiate MAC lists and professional-dispensing fees.\n•  **Oversight funding** – Appropriates $5 million to HHS OIG for periodic studies on cost variations and related-party transfer pricing, addressing long-standing concerns about vertically integrated PBMs.",

    "summary": "Requires all state Medicaid contracts with managed-care plans or PBMs to adopt a transparent pass-through model: ingredient cost + professional dispensing fee; bans spread pricing and limits PBM compensation to a flat administrative fee reflecting fair-market value.",
    "impact": "In-Depth:\n•  **Fiscal effect** – MACPAC estimates states lost ~$1.5 billion in FY 2021 to PBM spreads. A full pass-through model could redirect most of that to reduced state/federal spending or higher pharmacy dispensing fees.\n•  **Market behavior** – PBMs may shift to per-claim admin fees (e.g., $0.50-$1.50) rather than retaining hidden margins, aligning Medicaid with the CMS Medicare Part D rule effective 2025 and several state laws (OH, NY, WV).\n•  **340B carve-outs** – Provision allows covered entities to retain some margin above acquisition cost but mandates annual reporting, adding public visibility to a contentious space.\n•  **Implementation complexity** – States must amend MCO and PBM contracts within 18 months; smaller plans lacking cost-of-dispensing studies may need CMS technical assistance to set compliant fees.",

This federal funding ban may prompt new constitutional and administrative-law challenges.\n•  **Clinical guidance** – Contradicts positions of the American Academy of Pediatrics, AMA, and Endocrine Society, which deem gender-affirming care medically necessary for dysphoria and linked to reduced suicide risk.\n•  **Administrative complexity** – States would need new claim-level edits to flag and reject services tied to gender transition codes, adding compliance costs and risk of false denials for exception cases.",

    "impact": "•  **Federal savings** – GAO and OIG have flagged these payments—often exceeding Medicare by 200 %—as a fast-growing driver of Medicaid spending. Capping them could trim $4-6 billion a year in federal outlays.\n•  **Provider effect** – Hospitals in Texas, Florida, Kansas and other non-expansion States rely heavily on these directed payments to offset low base capitation; the 110 % ceiling could cut some facilities’ net Medicaid revenue by 20-30 %.\n•  **Behavioral shift** – May push States to move high-cost services back into fee-for-service UPL pools or revisit full ACA expansion to access the 100 % Medicare cap instead of 110 %.",

    "summary": "Mandates that every State, by 12-31-2026 (or earlier at State option), make 80 hours per month of work, job-training, community service, education, or equivalent earnings a condition of Medicaid eligibility for most Affordable Care Act expansion adults ages 19-64.  \n• **Verification & sanctions ** – States must confirm compliance at each redetermination (or more often) using ex-parte data when possible. Non-compliant beneficiaries receive a 30-day cure period; failure to cure results in denial of a new application or disenrollment.  \n• **Exemptions ** – Pregnant women; Medicare beneficiaries; TANF/SNAP work-compliant adults; full-time caregivers; veterans with total disability; the medically frail; American Indians/Alaska Natives; youth <19; postpartum women; and residents of disaster areas, high-unemployment counties, or certain institutions.  \n• **No §1115 waiver ** – The new §1902(xx) expressly bars CMS from waiving these requirements.  \n• **Federal grants ** – $100 million (FY-2026) for States’ IT/start-up costs plus $50 million for federal implementation/support.",
    "impact": "CBO has estimated that nationwide work/community-engagement mandates similar to this proposal would (1) cut federal Medicaid spending by $60–70 billion over ten years chiefly through coverage losses and (2) cause 1–2 million adults to become uninsured at any point in time.†  Administrative complexity historically leads to large procedural terminations—Arkansas’ 2018 waiver removed 18 % of targeted adults within five months.  Groups most affected include low-wage workers with volatile hours, people with mental-health/substance-use disorders, and residents of rural areas with limited broadband or transportation.  Courts vacated prior CMS approvals on \"work requirement\" waivers; codifying the policy in statute would override those rulings but would likely trigger fresh litigation under disability-rights and civil-rights laws.",

    "summary": "Starting 10-1-2028, ACA expansion adults (or equivalent waiver populations) with household income **above 100 % of the poverty line** become “specified individuals.”  States must:  \n• **Eliminate premiums/enrollment fees** for this group; and  \n• **Impose at least some copayment/coinsurance** on covered services (except primary care, mental-health, SUD treatment, preventive services, family-planning, emergency, pregnancy-related, and other §1916(a)(2)(B-J) exempt categories).  \nCopays may not exceed **$35 per item/service**, the existing §1916A drug limits, or an **aggregate family cap of 5 % of income** per month/quarter.  Providers may deny non-emergency services for non-payment.  Conforming changes to §1902 and §1916A clarify the premium prohibition and interaction with alternative cost-sharing rules.",
    "impact": "Roughly 6–7 million Medicaid expansion enrollees earn 100–138 % FPL.†  Imposing mandatory cost-sharing could save States $1–2 billion annually (shared with the federal government) but numerous studies show even $1–$5 Medicaid copays reduce prescription fills and outpatient visits, and may increase ER use and inpatient spending.  The policy limits charges on high-value services, yet beneficiaries with chronic conditions (diabetes, asthma) could still face dozens of $35 copays yearly.  Administrative overhead—tracking the 5 % income cap—will require upgraded claims systems and beneficiary notifications.  Safety-net providers may shoulder bad debt or alter billing practices.",

    "summary": "**Exchange enrollment windows.**  • Locks annual open-enrollment in the individual market at **Nov 1–Dec 15** starting PY 2026 and bars any “extra” Federal or State-level open windows.  • Prohibits future income-based special enrollment periods and requires Exchanges to pre-verify 75 % of SEP applicants.\n\n**Stronger eligibility verification.**  • Income attestations no longer accepted when IRS data are unavailable; large income discrepancies (>10 % or a State-approved dollar test) must be resolved before APTC is granted.  • Starting PY 2026 a consumer who received APTC in a prior year cannot get a new advance credit until the prior-year return is **filed and APTC reconciled**; a short provisional period is allowed on attestation.\n\n**Shortens inconsistency grace period.**  Eliminates the automatic extension that now stretches the 90-day period to clear income inconsistencies.\n\n**Plan design & actuarial value.**  • Reverts allowable AV “de-minimis” range to the tighter **±2 percentage-points** (2022 rule) for all metal tiers and resets silver-CSR variants to ±1 pt.  • Rescinds 2023 “meaningful difference/standardized option” flexibilities.\n\n**Cost-sharing & premium policy.**  • Returns the **premium-adjustment-percentage (PAP)** methodology to the more modest pre-2020 index, thereby slowing annual out-of-pocket maximum growth.  • Eliminates $- and %-threshold rules that allow issuers to write off tiny unpaid premiums.  • Prohibits automatic bronze-to-silver cross-walk reenrollments and cuts APTC by **$5 per month** for anyone who fails to update information during passive reenrollment.\n\n**Coverage exclusions & immigration.**  • Bars gender-transition procedures from being treated as essential-health-benefit services beginning PY 2027.  • Defines “lawfully present” to **exclude DACA recipients** for Marketplace eligibility, CSRs, and APTC.  • Allows issuers to deny new coverage (or apply the first premium to arrears) when the applicant owes unpaid premiums to any issuer in the same controlled group.\n\n**Administrative & compliance effects.**  • States must tighten SEP gate-keeping, income reconciliation, and premium-billing systems; CMS must update 45 CFR parts 155/156 accordingly.\n",
    "impact": "CBO has not yet scored the package, but earlier agency estimates of similar provisions project **$15–$20 billion** in ten-year federal savings, primarily from lower APTC/CSR outlays as enrollment falls.◆ Tight SEP and auto-reconciliation rules could push 500 k–1 million current enrollees off Marketplace coverage, many of whom cycle between Medicaid and Exchange plans or have unstable incomes.†  Consumers with unpaid premiums will face new barriers to re-entering coverage, and individuals passively re-enrolled without affirmatively updating data will see slightly higher after-credit premiums.  Transgender adults and adolescents would lose coverage of transition-related care in all Marketplace plans, potentially increasing reliance on employer or self-pay options and triggering litigation under Section 1557.  Excluding DACA beneficiaries reverses a 2023 CMS rule and would newly bar an estimated 100 k applicants, raising uncompensated-care burdens in safety-net systems.◊  Insurers welcome the ability to curb antiselection and collect past-due balances but will face higher verification costs and tighter product-design constraints.\n",

FUNDING COST SHARING REDUCTION PAYMENTS.\r\n\r\n    Section 1402 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 \r\nU.S.C. 18071) is amended by adding at the end the following new \r\nsubsection:\r\n    ``(h) Funding.--\r\n            ``(1) In general.--There are appropriated out of any monies \r\n        in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated such sums as may be \r\n        necessary for purposes of making payments under this section \r\n        for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2026.\r\n            ``(2) Limitation.--\r\n                    ``(A) In general.--The amounts appropriated under \r\n                paragraph (1) may not be used for purposes of making \r\n                payments under this section for a qualified health plan \r\n                that provides health benefit coverage that includes \r\n                coverage of abortion.\r\n                    ``(B) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply \r\n                to payments for a qualified health plan that provides \r\n                coverage of abortion only if necessary to save the life \r\n                of the mother or if the pregnancy is a result of an act \r\n                of rape or incest.''.",
    "summary": "Permanently appropriates \"such sums as necessary,\" beginning PY 2026, for the Department of the Treasury to reimburse insurers for **CSR discounts** mandated under §1402 of the ACA.  Includes a **Hyde amendment** rider: funds may not reimburse plans that cover abortion beyond life-endangerment, rape, or incest exceptions.",
    "impact": "Restores the direct CSR payment stream terminated in 2017, eliminating the need for insurers to load CSR costs into silver-plan premiums (“silver-loading”).  The Urban Institute estimates ending silver-loading would reduce premium-tax-credit outlays by **~$8–$10 billion per year** and modestly raise net premiums for unsubsidized enrollees in gold/bronze tiers.▴  States that redirected silver-loading windfalls to subsidize State-based initiatives would lose that extra funding.  The Hyde limitation mirrors existing Exchange abortion-segregation rules but adds an explicit bar on Treasury reimbursement, which may prompt carriers in a handful of States (e.g., CA, NY) to carve out elective-abortion benefits or forgo CSR payments.\n",

Any drug holding an FDA orphan-drug designation for one **or more** rare diseases will now remain exempt, and the ‘count-down clock’ toward negotiation for drugs that later lose orphan status will start only once that loss occurs.",
    "impact": "•  Fewer high-priced specialty medicines will enter the negotiation pipeline, reducing projected Medicare savings.\n•  Manufacturers gain stronger incentives to seek—and keep—multiple orphan designations, potentially delaying competition on certain blockbuster biologics.\n•  Beneficiaries with rare diseases may see improved drug availability, but overall Part D premiums or federal outlays could rise.",

    "summary": "Transforms the Medicare Part D & MA-PD supply chain from opaque percentage-based remuneration to a flat-fee, fully transparent model. Requires PBMs to divulge granular drug-level economics, bans spread-pricing, and empowers audits and federal oversight.",
    "impact": "•  Could lower premiums and beneficiary out-of-pocket costs if negotiated rebates flow directly to plan bids instead of PBM margins.\n•  Heightens compliance burden for PBMs; may prompt renegotiation of service-fee structures and affect pharmacy networks.\n•  Data transparency enables policymakers and researchers (MedPAC) to monitor drug-pricing dynamics, but confidentiality safeguards aim to protect proprietary information.",
