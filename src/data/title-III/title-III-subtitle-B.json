    "summary": "Repeals subsidized Stafford loans for undergraduates, eliminates PLUS loans for graduate students, sharply curtails PLUS loans for parents, and—starting July 1 2026—ties Unsubsidized Stafford annual eligibility to the median program cost, with new lifetime caps of $50 k (undergrad unsubsidized), $100 k (grad), $150 k (professional) and an overall $200 k aggregate for any borrower. Institutions may impose lower program-level borrowing ceilings at their discretion. A three-year transition window allows currently enrolled borrowers to finish under prior rules.",
    "impact": "Cuts total federal loan availability by an estimated 30-40 % (per CRS modeling) and shifts financing pressure to private markets, where rates and underwriting favor higher-income families. Low- and moderate-income undergrads lose interest subsidies that historically save ~$2,800 on a four-year degree, raising default risk. Graduate and professional programs—especially in medicine, law and aviation flight schools—face enrollment contractions unless they augment institutional aid or reduce tuition. Parent PLUS caps may push families at high-cost privates toward riskier home-equity or retirement-loan strategies. Schools gain authority to enforce prudent limits but could wield it inconsistently; ED will need new disclosure and counseling tools to avert confusion. Private-sector lenders and ISAs are likely to expand marketing to fill the gap, raising consumer-protection concerns.",
