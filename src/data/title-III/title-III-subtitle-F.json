    "summary": "Eliminates key federal accountability provisions for colleges: ▸ Repeals the 90/10 revenue test for proprietary schools. ▸ Strips all statutory references to “gainful employment,” removing the basis for debt-to-earnings accountability metrics. ▸ Vacates the 2022 borrower-defense and closed-school automatic-discharge regulations and revives the narrower 2020 framework. ▸ Bars the Education Department from re-issuing similar rules without new congressional authority.",
    "impact": "• For-profit colleges could rely entirely on federal aid, potentially encouraging aggressive recruiting of low-income students. \n• Removing gainful-employment language ends debt-to-earnings oversight, increasing the risk of low-value credentials. \n• Defrauded or stranded students would face higher hurdles to loan relief under the restored 2020 rules. \n• Taxpayers assume greater risk for future loan losses as borrower-defense discharges become rarer.",
