    "summary": "Creates a new two-track repayment regime for all Direct Loans first disbursed on/after July 1 2026. Borrowers must choose either (1) a tiered standard plan with 10-, 15-, 20- or 25-year amortization based on debt size or (2) a new income-based Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). RAP sets payments by a sliding AGI formula (1–10 % of income, less $50 per child) with a minimum $10 and caps payments at 360 qualifying payments, after which any balance is cancelled. Interest that the required payment doesn’t cover is subsidized, and small principal payments (< $50) are matched by ED. All legacy income-contingent options are repealed, and borrowers currently in ICR are automatically migrated to RAP within 9 months of enactment.",
    "impact": "• **Payment size:** Low-income borrowers will generally pay more than under the 2024 SAVE plan (which uses 5 % of discretionary income), whereas high-income borrowers could pay less because RAP caps at 10 % of AGI rather than 20 % of discretionary income.  CRS estimates median monthly payments for single borrowers earning $40 k would rise from ~$60 (SAVE) to ~$92 under RAP.﻿¹\n• **Forgiveness costs:** CBO models a 38 % reduction in long-run forgiveness outlays relative to SAVE, saving ~$72 B over ten years, but lengthening amortization for mid-income borrowers could raise default risk.﻿²\n• **Administrative risk:** Forced migration of more than 8 million ICR/SAVE borrowers inside nine months will stress servicers already operating at historically low call-center staffing and quality-control levels. Mistargeted conversions during the 2022 payment-pause restart generated >4 M erroneous bills; GAO warns a repeat is likely without new IT capacity.﻿³\n• **Equity concerns:** RAP’s $50-per-child deduction benefits larger families but offers no adjustment for caregivers of elderly relatives, and the plan eliminates poverty-line buffers that shield the lowest earners, potentially leaving some with payments above 5 % of income for the first time.",
