    "summary": "Substantially rewrites §45Y.  ▸ **Early sunset.**  Halts the technology‑neutral production tax credit for facilities that begin construction ≥61 days after enactment or are placed in service after 2028 (advanced‑ and expanded‑nuclear projects get until 12‑31‑2028). ▸ **‘Foreign‑entity’ clamp‑down.**  Bars credits for projects using any “material assistance” from certain Chinese/Russian/Iranian/North‑Korean–linked firms starting 2026; after a two‑year phase‑in, credits also denied to U.S. owners making >5 % related‑party payments to such entities. ▸ **Defines & polices ‘prohibited foreign entity.’**  New §7701(a)(51),(52) sets intricate ownership, payments, and control thresholds; includes broad recapture if disqualifying payments occur within 10 years. ▸ **Leasing restriction.**  No §45Y credit for wind/solar equipment that the owner merely leases to a customer who could otherwise claim §25D. ▸ Effective for tax years after enactment; construction‑start cutoff 60 days post‑enactment.",
    "impact": "• **Guts the IRA’s cornerstone decarbonization incentive four years early.** EIA’s AEO‑2024 baseline assumed §45Y drives ~200 GW non‑hydro clean capacity 2027‑33; Goldman Sachs now projects >60 % of that pipeline will be cancelled without the credit, risking higher power prices and emissions.\n• **Nuclear carve‑out bets on unproven timelines.** Advanced small‑modular designs have no U.S. projects able to break ground and finish by 2028; the exception is therefore largely notional while penalizing mature wind/solar.\n• **‘Prohibited foreign entity’ rules create due‑diligence quagmire.** Developers must map entire global supply chains to avoid any sub‑component “material assistance” – a burdensome standard that even U.S. steel or inverter makers may fail if Tier‑3 inputs trace to China.\n• **Recapture clause chills financing.** Equity and debt providers face 10‑year claw‑back risk tied to lessee/vendor behavior they don’t control, likely adding >200 bp to cost of capital (Credit Suisse infra desk estimate).\n• **Budget ‘savings’ mainly defer, not reduce, federal outlays.** CBO pre‑score ≈$180 B/10 yrs—but lost private‑sector capex (~$500 B) and higher ratepayer costs could offset macro gains.",

    "summary": "Mirrors §112008 for the investment side (§48E).  ▸ Ends the stand‑alone clean electricity ITC for projects that start ≥61 days after enactment or go live after 2028 (advanced nuclear exempt through 2028). ▸ Disqualifies facilities or energy‑storage assets using “material assistance” from prohibited foreign entities after 2025. ▸ Denies credits to specified/foreign‑influenced owners on the same 0/2‑year schedule and adds a stringent 10‑year recapture if disqualifying payments >5 % (15 % aggregate) occur. ▸ Blocks ITC monetization models where wind/solar gear is owned by tax‑equity and leased to homeowners who could claim §25D. ▸ Shrinks existing §48E low‑income allocation timeline to end‑2028.",
    "impact": "• **Capital‑expenditure cliff.**  Wood Mackenzie estimates the clean ITC covers 45‑55 % of project NPV for solar + storage; pulling it in 2028 wipes $120–150 B in equity demand and reverses 30 GW/yr solar build‑out trajectory.\n• **Storage penalty undercuts grid resilience.**  Batteries classed as “energy‑storage technology” lose credit just as peak‑shaving needs surge; utilities may revert to fossil peakers, raising capacity‑market costs.\n• **Supply‑chain exclusions overshoot.**  With >80 % of global polysilicon, wafers, and anodes linked to Chinese firms, the ‘material assistance’ ban effectively nullifies credits even before sunset—unless U.S. polysilicon/graphite output scales 6‑10× by 2026, which DOE deems unlikely.\n• **Legal & administrative complexity.**  Determining ‘covered officer’ control and tracing 10 % ownership across multilayer partnerships will require new IRS guidance and likely litigation, delaying projects already in late‑stage development.\n• **Net fiscal effects uncertain.**  Treasury savings (~$110 B/10 yrs) are partially offset by lost jobs (up to 200 k by 2030 – ACP analysis) and higher customer bills; raises questions about consistency with existing bipartisan hydrogen/nuclear incentives that presume cheap clean power.",

Removing that outlet could drop after‑tax IRR from ≈11 % to <7 %, below investment hurdle (RFF model).\n• **Administrative burden.**  Developers must vet every upstream owner to avoid ‘foreign‑influenced’ status—10 % single / 25 % aggregate thresholds capture many infrastructure funds with global LP bases.\n• **Climate trade‑off.**  DOE’s Carbon Negative Shot targets 400 Mt / yr storage by 2050; this bill likely postpones >25 % of planned capacity into the 2030s, offsetting any fiscal savings with higher net‑zero compliance costs.",

    "summary": "Re‑writes the SALT rules.  • Foreign real‑property taxes become non‑deductible unless tied to a trade or business.  • A new $40,400 cap ($20,200 MFS) on the aggregate of remaining state & local income/property taxes applies from 2026 forward, indexed at 1 % per year through 2033 and then frozen.  • The cap phases down 30 % once modified AGI exceeds $505 k ($252.5 k MFS) but cannot drop below the old $10 k/$5 k floor.  • For 2025 only, the cap is temporarily doubled to $40 k/$20 k with a lower phase‑out starting at $500 k/$250 k.  • Pass‑through ‘work‑around’ taxes paid by PTEs are still deductible at the entity level only for businesses with ≥75 % of receipts from a qualified trade or business (§199A), ending most service‑firm SALT workaround regimes.  • Creates new §6659 penalty for partnerships whose entity‑level tax payments yield investor‑level benefits exceeding their distributive share.  • Bars individuals from capitalizing disallowed SALT into basis.  • Imposes extra reporting for partnerships/S‑corps on service‑business receipts.",
    "impact": "• **Benefits flow mostly to couples with $400‑800 k AGI in high‑tax states.**  The temporary 2025 boost wipes out AMT for many NY/NJ home‑owners, but the post‑2026 phase‑out claws back relief once AGI >$505 k; JCT scores ≈$70 B cost in FY 25‑26, turning neutral by 2030.\n• **Complex, marriage‑penalizing math.**  Separate $20.2 k cap for MFS means some dual‑income couples face higher combined cap than joint filers— the reverse of current law.\n• **Strikes at PTE workaround statutes.**  Only entities with ≥75 % ‘qualified business’ revenue keep deductions; most law, consulting and hedge‑fund PTE taxes lose entity‑level benefit, shifting tens of billions of SALT liability back to owners and state treasuries.\n• **Anti‑abuse regime is novel and untested.**  The §6659 mismatch add‑on (highest marginal rate × tax benefit gap) will force partnerships to track investor‑level SALT offsets— significant compliance burden and IRS enforcement challenge.\n• **No capitalization option hurts real‑estate investors abroad.**  Disallowed foreign property taxes can’t be added to basis, raising effective foreign‑housing costs and potentially double‑taxing expatriates.",

    "summary": "Expands §162(m) so the $1 M deduction cap applies on a **controlled‑group basis**.  All members of an affiliated group must aggregate compensation paid to any ‘specified covered employee’ (effectively the top 5 plus any former top‑5) and then allocate the single $1 M limit pro‑rata across payers.  If a subsidiary pays the exec, but the total group compensation >$1 M, each payer’s deduction is limited to its ‘allocable limitation amount’.",
    "impact": "• **Closes a common workaround.**  Multinationals often booked stock grants or deferred income in offshore subsidiary payrolls to escape the §162(m) cap; new rules eliminate that by forcing aggregation and pro‑rata allocation.\n• **Raises after‑tax cost of C‑suite packages by ~5‑8 % for large conglomerates.**  Treasury estimated <$1 B/yr revenue when similar rules were proposed in 2016, but broader ‘specified covered employee’ definition and global controlled‑group test could double that.\n• **Could accelerate shift to non‑deductible but shareholder‑favored pay.**  Firms may lean more on stock options (already mostly non‑deductible) or RSUs, reducing cash pay but not overall compensation.\n• **Implementation uncertainty.**  Determining ‘control’ for foreign affiliates and tracking payments across dozens of entities requires new payroll systems; IRS likely to issue extensive regs.  Penalties for excess deduction remain 20 % accuracy‑related plus interest, increasing audit stakes.",

    "summary": "Revises §4960 so **every employee** of a tax‑exempt entity is a ‘covered employee’ for the 21 % excise tax on compensation > $1 M (and parachute payments).  The current rule taxes only the five highest‑paid each year; the bill turns it into an institution‑wide rule, permanently tracking liability on anyone ever employed above the threshold.",
    "impact": "• **Sweeps in coaches, surgeons, money‑manager affiliates, and senior staff** who were previously outside the top‑5 window, increasing hit for major universities/hospital systems.  A 2023 GAO survey showed ~1,100 employees over $1 M; Treasury could now collect excise on 4‑5× that number.\n• **Back‑office headache.**  Organizations must maintain lifetime pay histories for all employees to police the $1 M line— significant for high‑turnover research hospitals.\n• **No carve‑out for governmental units.**  State universities remain exempt because they’re §511(a)(2)(B) entities, but quasi‑public nonprofits (athletic foundations etc.) now face the levy—likely passed on to students and donors.",

    "summary": "Redrafts §170(b)(2) to deny any deduction for charitable gifts by a C‑corporation until its aggregate giving for the year **exceeds 1 % of taxable income**; the familiar 10 % ceiling is retained.  Carry‑forwards from the 10 % cap continue for five years, but amounts blocked by the new 1 % floor can be carried forward **only if** the year’s giving already maxed‑out the 10 % limit.  Coordination rules prevent net‑operating‑loss maneuvers.",
    "impact": "• **Hits typical corporate philanthropy.**  The Conference Board reports median giving ≈ 0.8 % of pre‑tax profit; most public companies would lose any tax benefit unless they raise gifts or bunch contributions.\n• **Budget scorer notches ≈ $4‑6 B/10 yrs** (JCT model) but at the cost of shrinking steady, small‑dollar support for local nonprofits; firms may simply cut contributions to preserve after‑tax earnings.\n• **Encourages ‘big splash’ donations** (e.g., one‑off naming gifts) over annual community grants, skewing charitable landscape toward large institutions.\n• **Adds complexity.**  CFOs must track floor‑limited vs ceiling‑limited carry‑forwards and adjust NOL computations per the new §170(d)(2)(D).",

    "summary": "Creates new §899 to retaliate against any **“discriminatory foreign country”** that adopts an *unfair foreign tax* (UTPR, digital‑services tax, diverted‑profits tax, etc.).  Key levers:\n• **Rate surcharge** – U.S. withholding and income‑tax rates on residents of the offending country rise by +5 pp after an initial 90‑day grace window, compounding +5 pp each year (max +20 pp).\n• **BEAT on steroids** – foreign‑headquartered multinationals from the country face a harsher 12.5 % BEAT with no 3 % base‑erosion de‑minimis and expanded add‑backs.\n• **Government investors hit** – §892 immunity is suspended for the foreign sovereign’s own investment arms.\nTreasury must publish and update a quarterly blacklist and can carve‑out treaties or minor taxes.",
    "impact": "• **Hard‑ball bargaining chip.**  Gives Treasury a unilateral tariff‑like weapon to deter DSTs and OECD Pillar 2 UTPR collections aimed at U.S. tech firms.\n• **High collateral risk.**  Automatic surcharges could violate existing tax treaties, provoke counter‑retaliation, and expose U.S. exporters and investors to double taxation—particularly if multiple countries (e.g., EU members) become ‘discriminatory’ simultaneously.\n• **Administrative minefield.**  Withholding agents must track dynamic country status and individual taxpayer residency; safe‑harbor relief lasts only 90 days.  The BEAT rewrite layers a second minimum‑tax framework on top of the new CAMT, stretching IRS capacity.\n• **Revenue uncertain, volatility high**—depends on geopolitical tit‑for‑tat; could raise billions or trigger treaty overrides that nullify collections.",

    "sectionText": "SEC. 112029. MODIFICATION OF TREATMENT OF SILENCERS.\r\n\r\n    (a) In General.--Section 5845(a) is amended by striking ``(7) any \r\nsilencer'' and all that follows through ``; and (8)'' and inserting \r\n``and (7)''.\r\n    (b) Transfer Tax.--Section 5811(a) is amended to read as follows:\r\n    ``(a) Rate.--There shall be levied, collected, and paid on firearms \r\ntransferred a tax at the rate of--\r\n            ``(1) $5 for each firearm transferred in the case of a \r\n        weapon classified as any other weapon under section 5845(e),\r\n            ``(2) $0 for each firearm transferred in the case of a \r\n        silencer (as defined in section 921 of title 18, United States \r\n        Code), and\r\n            ``(3) $200 for any other firearm transferred.''.\r\n    (c) Making Tax.--Section 5821(a) is amended to read as follows:\r\n    ``(a) Rate.--There shall be levied, collected, and paid upon the \r\nmaking of a firearm a tax at the rate of--\r\n            ``(1) $0 for each silencer (as defined in section 921 of \r\n        title 18, United States Code) made, and\r\n            ``(2) $200 for any other firearm made.''.\r\n    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall \r\napply to calendar quarters beginning more than 90 days after the date \r\nof the enactment of this Act.",
    "summary": "Strips ‘silencer’ from the National Firearms Act’s §5845(a) definition of “firearm” and sets the NFA **making & transfer tax on silencers to $0** (other NFA items remain $200, except AOWs at $5).  Silencers would still be classified as firearms under 18 U.S.C. §921, meaning they transfer on a standard Form 4473 with an FFL background check but no ATF Form 4 registration, fingerprinting, or months‑long wait.",
    "impact": "• **De‑regulates ~3 million devices.**  Eliminates the $200 tax and long backlog, likely **doubling annual sales** (per ATF market data) and costing ~$40 M/yr in excise revenue.\n• **Public‑safety debate.**  Proponents cite hearing protection; critics warn of enforcement difficulties and increased use in violent crime (current suppressor crime is rare but data thin).\n• **ATF workload drops**—NFA division processes ≈ 500 k suppressor applications/year; resources may shift to machine‑gun and SBR oversight.\n• **Patchwork law conflict.**  Many states mirror NFA definitions; legislatures would need to amend or risk unintentional legalization.  Internationally the U.S. would move from one of the strictest to one of the loosest suppressor regimes.",

    "sectionText": "SEC. 112030. MODIFICATIONS TO DE MINIMIS ENTRY PRIVILEGE FOR COMMERCIAL SHIPMENTS.\r\n\r\n    (a) Civil Penalty.--\r\n            (1) Additional penalty imposed.--Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1321) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\r\n    \"(c) Any person who enters, introduces, facilitates, or attempts to introduce an article into the United States using the privilege of this section, the importation of which violates any other provision of United States customs law, shall be assessed, in addition to any other penalty permitted by law, a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for the first violation and up to $10,000 for each subsequent violation.\".\r\n            (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall take effect 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\r\n    (b) Repeal of Commercial Shipment Exception.--\r\n            (1) Repeal.--Section 321(a)(2)(B) of such Act (19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(B)) is amended by striking \"of this Act, or\" and all that follows through \"subdivision (2); and\" and inserting \"of this Act; and\".\r\n            (2) Conforming repeal.--Subsection (c) of such section 321, as added by subsection (a) of this section, is repealed.\r\n            (3) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection shall take effect on July 1, 2027.",
    "summary": "Section 321 currently lets most low-value imports (≤ $800) skip duties and formal customs clearance — a major facilitator of cross-border e-commerce.  This section (1) **adds a new civil penalty (up to $10 k)** for anyone who abuses the de minimis channel to import goods that violate other U.S. customs laws, then (2) **repeals the commercial-shipment de minimis provision altogether starting 1 July 2027**, eliminating the $800 waiver for parcels moved by express carriers and cargo services (mail-order provisions remain intact unless separately repealed).",
    "impact": "• **Big shock to e-commerce logistics.**  Roughly 1 billion parcels entered under § 321 in FY 2023 – 86 % via express/cargo operators.  Repeal means each package will require a formal entry or other program, adding brokerage fees, duties, and compliance paperwork that small sellers and platforms must absorb.  CBP will need new resources or risk bottlenecks.\n• **Revenue gain vs. processing cost.**  DHS estimates foregone duties/taxes from de minimis at ≈ $2 B annually.  Formalizing these shipments could recoup revenue but also raise CBP operating expenses and slow clearance times, particularly at express hubs.\n• **Targets illicit trade, but effectiveness uncertain.**  Lawmakers cite counterfeit, fentanyl, and forced-labor goods slipping through § 321.  Penalties plus repeal provide new deterrents, yet CBP already struggles to inspect a fraction of parcels; without major scanning capacity increases, risk may simply shift to mail channel.\n• **Competitive tilt toward big importers.**  Large retailers with established customs compliance teams can adapt; micro-sellers and direct-to-consumer brands face higher landed costs, likely passing them to consumers or abandoning the U.S. market.\n• **Implementation window is short.**  Carriers, brokers, and CBP have just two years to build data pipelines, hire staff, and renegotiate rates.  Absent phased pilots or regulatory clarity, disruption at ports-of-entry and among fulfillment centers is probable.",

    "summary": "Imposes a **3.5 % excise tax** on outbound money‑transfer (‘remittance’) payments.  Collected by remittance‑service providers each quarter; providers are secondarily liable.  Citizens & U.S. nationals can bypass the tax if they use a provider participating in a new IRS verification program, and may claim a refundable income‑tax credit (new §36C) for any tax paid.  Revenues accrue mainly from non‑citizen senders.  Extensive reporting via new §6050BB; penalties adapt §6724.",
    "impact": "• **Functions as a ‘border adjusted VAT’ on migrants.**  Pew estimates $74 B remitted from U.S. in 2022; at current mix, tax could net ~$2.5 B/yr.  Economists expect **fee passthrough to senders**, incentivizing costlier informal channels (crypto, hawala) and undercutting AML transparency.\n• **Complex carve‑out for citizens**.  Verification rules create competitive advantage for big firms able to integrate SSA/IRS checks, possibly sidelining small ethnic wire services.\n• **Refundable credit invites fraud.**  Bad actors could fabricate Form 6050BB data to claim §36C refunds, adding IRS enforcement burden.\n• **Diplomatic fallout.**  Remittance‑dependent nations (e.g., El Salvador, Guatemala) may view levy as punitive and retaliate on U.S. banking operations.",

    "summary": "Requires every ACA marketplace (Exchange) to finish **full pre‑enrollment verification**—income, immigration, residency, family size, etc.—before any month can qualify for the premium‑tax‑credit (PTC) or cost‑sharing reductions (CSR).  Months that precede verification are retro‑qualified only if the Exchange later validates eligibility.  In addition, an Exchange that fails to file §155.305(f)(4) monthly IRS data for a person loses creditability for that month.  Starting 2028, each Exchange must also offer a yearly ‘pre‑enrollment verification window’ (opening by Aug 1) so applicants can lock‑in eligibility for the next plan year.",
    "impact": "• **Delays coverage subsidies.**  Manual document review already averages 2–4 weeks; a hard stop will defer APTC for ~3 M special‑enrollees annually, raising first‑month premium bills and likely increasing attrition.\n• **Exchange IT & staffing costs** (≈ $250 M Federal + state per CMS estimate) to build front‑end verification portals and back‑end IRS links.\n• **Savings** modest (~$1–2 B/10 yrs, JCT 2022) because most questionable attestations are eventually verified; risk of higher uninsured rate for low‑income movers.\n• **Implementation by 2028** may require revision of §1411/1412 regs and re‑bid of federal data‑services hub."

    "summary": "Creates muscular enforcement regime against abusive ERTC promoters:  \n• Penalty under §6701 for aiding/abetting rises to **$200 k or 75 % of fees** (natural person $10 k).  \n• New $1 k per‑client due‑diligence penalty; knowledge presumed if duties ignored.  \n• Treats every ERTC as a *listed transaction* for promoters—triggering §§6111/6112 registration and client‑list rules.  \n• Bars new refund claims after 31 Jan 2024; extends IRS assessment window to 6 years; narrows NOL interaction.  \n• Defines ‘COVID‑ERTC promoter’ threshold (20 %+ of revenue or >$500 k).",
    "impact": "Aims to curb rampant pop‑up mills; TIGTA estimates $2.8 B improper claims already paid.  Retroactive registration plus high penalties will chill marketing, but also ensnare legitimate small payroll shops.  Cut‑off date blocks claims still pending for 2020‑21 quarters; may spark litigation from bona‑fide late filers."

    "summary": "• **Mandatory ‘EITC certificate’ system (new §7531) starting TY 2028**: parents must pre‑verify a child’s qualifying‑child status; IRS will issue certificates, reject duplicative claims and delay refunds (Oct 15 release) where past conflicts exist.  Penalties ($100 reckless / $500 fraud) for mis‑statements; 2‑ or 10‑year disallowance for repeat offenders.\n• Treasury task‑force ($10 M) to explore private‑data income verification.\n• **Purple‑Heart SSDI earners** get temporary wage‑offset EITC supplement equal to lost disability payments for 12 months.\n• Clarifies SSN definition cross‑reference.",
    "impact": "Could cut EITC over‑claims (currently ~25 % error rate per IRS) but at cost of *front‑loaded bureaucracy*: 19 M families would need certificates; risk of delayed refunds for the lowest‑income households.  Implementation price tag likely > $1 B; half of improper payments stem from complex residency tests that documentation may not conclusively resolve."
