    "sectionText": "SEC. 113001. MODIFICATION OF LIMITATION ON THE PUBLIC DEBT.\r\n\r\n    The limitation under section 3101(b) of title 31, United States \r\nCode, as most recently increased by section 401(b) of Public Law 118-5 \r\n(31 U.S.C. 3101 note), is increased by $4,000,000,000,000.",
    "summary": "Raises the statutory debt ceiling set in 31 U.S.C. § 3101(b) by **$4 trillion** beyond the level last amended in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Pub. L. 118‑5).  The new limit takes effect upon enactment.",
    "impact": "• Extends Treasury’s borrowing authority, projected to postpone the next debt‑limit deadline into FY 2026 (per CBO baseline).  \n• Prevents default risk but adds headroom equal to ~14 % of FY 2025 GDP.  \n• No accompanying fiscal guardrails or sunset mechanism; Congress retains power to modify again."
