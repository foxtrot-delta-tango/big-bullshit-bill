    "summary": "Revises the citizenship-or-immigration test in §484(a)(5) of the Higher Education Act so that, beginning with award year 2025-26, only U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, certain Cuban parolees awaiting visas, and Compact of Free Association migrants qualify for federal student aid.",
    "impact": "Codifies the long-standing exclusion of DACA and other undocumented students from Title IV aid and removes flexibility for future administrative relief. Public colleges that currently use institutional aid to enroll these populations could lose tuition revenue, and affected students would face higher borrowing costs or abandonment of degree plans. CRS notes that roughly 1.7 million undocumented students are enrolled in U.S. higher education, most of whom pay out-of-state or private rates and would see affordability worsen :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.",

    "summary": "Overhauls need analysis beginning in award year 2026-27: (1) limits a student’s \"cost of attendance\" for aid purposes to the **median cost of college** for that program nationally; (2) redefines COA calculations to track expenses for each specific program of study; (3) instructs ED to publish a new §472A methodology using NCES CIP codes and credential levels; and (4) exempts the value of a family-owned farm or small business (<100 employees) from assets used in need calculation.",
    "impact": "The median-cost cap could reduce aid eligibility for students in high-price regions or specialized programs (e.g., aviation, health sciences) while marginally increasing aid at low-cost institutions. Analysts warn that the change introduces volatility because the ‘median’ will shift annually and relies on schools submitting consistent, disaggregated COA data—something GAO has found to be error-prone in 91 % of aid offers :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Policy groups argue the proposal could sow confusion and create new “aid cliffs,” especially for independent students with higher living costs :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. Institutions must also map programs to six-digit CIP codes and credential levels under NCES standards, requiring costly SIS and catalog updates :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.",
