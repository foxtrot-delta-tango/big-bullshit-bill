    "summary": "Extends 100 % bonus depreciation by three additional years (through 2029 for most assets, 2030 for aircraft/long‑production and specified plants) and sets a 0 % rate thereafter.  Allows post‑1/19/2025 acquisitions to qualify at 100 % and updates contract‑binding rules.",
    "impact": "• **Front‑loads tax savings:** boosts near‑term investment—especially in capital‑intensive manufacturing, trucking, and farming—but enlarges long‑run deficits.\n• **Uneven benefits:** cash‑rich corporations gain most; smaller firms with limited taxable income capture little.\n• **Creates a new ‘2029 cliff’:** uncertainty may again chill orders as sunset nears.\n• **Maintains debt bias:** accelerates cost recovery without indexing basis, favouring leveraged equipment spending over labour.",

    "summary": "Creates §168(n) granting 100 % bonus depreciation for the *building portion* of newly constructed U.S. facilities used in manufacturing, refining, or agricultural production—projects started 1/20/2025‑12/31/2028 and placed in service by 2032—with a 10‑year recapture if repurposed.",
    "impact": "• **Unprecedented full expensing for structures**—a costly subsidy (~$60 B) that heavily skews investment toward real estate.\n• **Industrial policy by definition:** government picks winners (factory floor yes, data‑centre no), likely spurring boundary‑pushing claims.\n• **Recapture teeth dulled:** after 10 years firms can pivot without paying back benefits, encouraging strategic timing.\n• **Could undermine Pillar Two:** large bonus write‑offs depress effective tax rates, risking foreign top‑ups.",

\r\n                the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.",
    "summary": "• Tightens **low‑income community** definition (drops qualifying income threshold to 70 %, bars tracts ≥125 % of area median).\n• Authorises a **second wave (2027‑2033) of zone designations**; at least one‑third (or greater, matching national share) must be fully rural.\n• Provides **basis step‑ups** of 10 % after 5 years (30 % for rural OZ funds) for post‑2026 investments and extends deferral window to 12/31/2033.\n• Allows ≤$10 k of **ordinary income** roll‑over, lowers improvement test to 50 % for rural real‑estate projects, including data‑centres.\n• Imposes **robust reporting** on funds, investors, and businesses with stiff penalties (up to $250 k) and mandates Treasury’s public impact reports.",
    "impact": "• **Course‑corrects—but doesn’t cure—gentrification risk:** Higher‑income tracts excluded; rural quota may spread capital outside booming metros, yet still leaves high‑rent ‘hot spots’ from first round intact until 2026.\n• **Transparency finally arrives** via granular filings; however, data lags and aggregation rules could blunt watchdog value.\n• **New rural bonus (30 % basis bump)** gives investors richer upside in low‑capacity regions but could encourage land speculation without operating business growth.\n• **Extends program life to 2033, creating two classes of zones** (2018 vs 2027), complicating compliance and potentially fragmenting investor attention.\n• **Revenue cost rises** (JCT est. ≈$15‑20 B) while empirical benefits remain inconclusive; critics fear windfalls for high‑net‑worth investors persist.\n• **Administrative burden spikes:** small funds face daily‑asset valuation rules, investor statements, electronic filing—deterring community‑scale capital.",

    "impact": "• **Fewer forms for micro‑contractors** and landlords, cutting paperwork for very‑small businesses.\n• **Revenue downside**—IRS loses third‑party data on billions in payments; voluntary compliance historically drops when information reporting disappears.\n• **Creates real‑vs‑nominal creep:** inflation indexing prevents threshold erosion but locks in higher gap for decades.\n• **Potential state mis‑alignment:** many states piggy‑back on federal $600 rule; they must now choose between conformity or creating dual thresholds.",

    "summary": "Broadens Medicare’s Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) category to include shuttered critical‑access and ≤50‑bed rural hospitals that were **not** enrolled in Medicare on 12‑27‑2020 and provides tailored licensing/application timelines.  Facilities within 35 miles of another hospital must, after one year, prove that >50 % of their volume is emergency/outpatient care.  Near‑by REHs also lose the 5 % payment bump for outpatient services; those <10 miles lose the facility‑fee altogether.",
    "impact": "• **Could revive 300‑plus closed rural sites**, improving geographic access but also straining already thin rural workforces; many closed buildings have deteriorated infrastructure and will need costly upgrades that the bill does not subsidize.\n• **Service‑mix guardrail may backfire**—the >50 % emergency/outpatient threshold for close‑proximity facilities could push them to under‑serve profitable post‑acute or diagnostic services, limiting financial sustainability.\n• **Two‑tier payment policy introduces inequity**: REHs >35 miles keep the 5 % add‑on and facility fee, while those closer to existing hospitals do not, potentially creating a \"cliff\" where five extra miles equals millions in lost revenue.\n• **States hold the veto** via licensing deadlines; in politically divided States that dislike REH, missing the 2027‑or‑one‑year window effectively blocks conversion—an unspoken but real constraint.\n• **Medicare trust‑fund exposure** modest (<$1 B/10yrs per CBO prelim) but CMS will need new audit capacity to verify distance‑based volume tests—administrative cost not scored.",
