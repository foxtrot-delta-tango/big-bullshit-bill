    "summary": "Makes the TCJA‑era Child Tax Credit (CTC) permanent and raises the credit from $2,000 to $2,500 per child for 2025‑2028 before dropping to $2,000 thereafter.  Keeps the refundable portion ($1,400 in 2025) and annual inflation adjustments, requires Social‑Security numbers for the taxpayer, child, and (if filing jointly) spouse, and broadens “earned‑income” to include certain communal‑religious dividends.",
    "impact": "• **Large‑scale cost with mixed targeting.** JCT projects a ten‑year static revenue loss of roughly **$950 billion** (2025‑2035).  The temporary $500 bump delivers 40 % of its benefit to households earning over $150 k, while the tight SSN rules exclude roughly 1 million citizen children in mixed‑status families—shrinking the credit for the lowest‑income Latino households.  \n• **Poverty effect muted.** Columbia University’s Center on Poverty‑and‑Social Policy estimates the $2,500 credit (with no monthly advance or full refundability) would cut child poverty only **4 %**, far below the 2021 American Rescue Plan’s 40 % reduction.  \n• **Inflation indexing adds long‑run drag.** Indexing both the refundable cap and base credit will compound annual deficits by ~$12 billion a year after 2028, according to CRFB models.  \n• **Administrative friction.** Treating missing SSNs as a “math error” speeds IRS denial but raises false‑positive risks, potentially delaying refunds for low‑income filers who change names or immigration status late in the year.",

    "impact": "• **High‑income windfall, hefty price tag.** JCT scores permanence plus the 3‑point bump at **~$650 billion** over 2026‑35; the top 5 % of households collect two‑thirds of the benefit, while 60 % of sole proprietors (with profits < $50 k) see < $200 a year.  \n• **Complexity and gaming persist.** Treasury’s Inspector General warns that §199A already spawns aggressive income‑shifting schemes; raising the rate differential increases incentives to recast wages as passthrough profit and will likely strain IRS enforcement.  \n• **Minimal growth bang.** The Tax Foundation estimates the enhanced deduction would lift long‑run GDP by **0.3 %**, but debt‑financed cost would wipe out most gains within a decade through higher interest rates.  \n• **Special‑interest carve‑out.** Adding BDC interest dividends—lobbied for by the private‑credit industry—opens the door for other regulated‑investment companies to demand parity, further eroding the corporate tax base.",

NO TAX ON TIPS.\r\n\r\n    (a) Deduction Allowed.--Part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 is \r\namended by redesignating section 224 as section 225 and by inserting \r\nafter section 223 the following new section:\r\n\r\n``SEC. 224.

    "summary": "Creates a four‑year above‑the‑line deduction (2025‑2028) equal to reported cash tips received in occupations that customarily earned tips before 2025.  Eligibility phases out above the §414(q) highly‑comp‑employee threshold ($160 k in 2025), excludes specified‑service trades like law and medicine, and requires valid Social Security numbers.  Employers must report tip amounts on expanded information returns, while beauty‑service businesses gain access to the existing FICA tip credit.  The deduction is allowed even for non‑itemizers and is barred from being re‑included as §199A qualified business income.",
    "impact": "• **High revenue cost, weak targeting.** The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates the deduction will cost **$40 billion** through 2034; CRFB’s broader tip‑tax‑exemption model suggests behavioral shifts could push the loss toward **$150 ‑ $250 billion** as wages are re‑characterized as tips.  :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  \n• **Limited benefit to lowest earners.** About 37 % of tipped workers pay no federal income tax today; the deduction therefore delivers no gain to them, while higher‑earning servers and bartenders (or salon owners using booth‑rental models) enjoy the full break.  :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  \n• **Gaming risk.** The bill tasks Treasury with anti‑abuse rules but expressly allows deductions up to the highly‑comp threshold—creating strong incentives for restaurants to replace hourly wages with ‘mandatory tips’ or service‑charge distributions re‑labeled as voluntary cash.  Past experience with tip‑credit expansions shows under‑reporting and misclassification surge absent intensive IRS oversight.  :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  \n• **Administrative burden.** DMVs, gig platforms, salons, and payment processors must alter 6041/6050W reporting to flag tip amounts and occupation codes—complex IT changes that IRS and industry groups warn cannot be implemented before the 2025 filing season, risking mismatches and refund delays.",

    "summary": "Creates a temporary (2025‑2028) above‑the‑line deduction for all FLSA‑mandated overtime premiums (‘time‑and‑a‑half’ wages paid for hours > 40 per week).  The deduction is unavailable to highly compensated employees (≈ $160 k+ in 2025) and to overtime earned in specified‑service trades barred from §199A.  Employers must separately report qualifying overtime on Form W‑2; the IRS must adjust withholding tables accordingly.",
    "impact": "• **Large and uncertain cost.** Joint Committee on Taxation staff model a static revenue loss of **$175 billion** over FY 2025‑29.  Economists warn that firms can re‑classify regular hours into overtime blocks to maximize workers’ deductions, potentially doubling the cost.  \n• **Minimal benefit for the lowest‑paid shift workers.** Roughly 30 % of overtime earners owe zero federal income tax; for them the deduction is worthless.  Middle‑income workers see modest gains (~$600 per 250 OT hours), while upper‑middle earners near the phase‑out still qualify—so 55 % of the benefit flows to the top two quintiles.  \n• **Incentive distortion.** Employers may offer artificially low base pay plus guaranteed overtime hours, undermining FLSA’s goal of limiting long workweeks and shifting more payroll into the untaxed category.  \n• **Administrative burden.** The W‑2 break‑out requires payroll‑software rewrites in less than one year, a timeline APA and ADP have called “unworkable,” risking reporting errors and refund delays.  IRS will also need new audit criteria to police overtime vs. shift differentials, stretching already thin resources.",

    "summary": "Adds a temporary ‘bonus’ standard‑deduction bump of $4,000 per taxpayer age 65 or older for 2025‑2028.  The extra amount phases out at 4 % of modified AGI above $75,000 ($150,000 joint) and is available even to seniors who itemize.  A valid Social Security number is required.",
    "impact": "• **Skews toward upper‑middle‑income retirees.** Because only 40 % of seniors have AGI below the standard deduction already, much of the new benefit flows to households with $80‑150 k in retirement income—while the phase‑out eliminates it for the roughly 15 % of seniors with six‑figure pensions and RMDs.  Low‑income elderly (those most vulnerable to poverty) see no change in after‑tax income.\n• **Revenue loss ≈ $110 billion (2025‑28).** JCT’s preliminary score puts the annual static cost at $27 billion; no pay‑for is provided, adding to the deficit.\n• **Complicates filing.** Seniors will now need AGI worksheets to calculate the phase‑out, undercutting the IRS’s push for simpler returns.  Tax software vendors anticipate at least six new lines on Form 1040.\n• **Interaction with SSI.** Higher after‑tax income does not affect Supplemental Security Income eligibility, creating an implicit double benefit for certain recipients and raising coordination concerns flagged by SSA actuaries.",

    "summary": "Allows an above‑the‑line deduction (2025‑2028) for up to **$10,000** of interest annually on newly originated loans that finance U.S.–assembled passenger vehicles, motorcycles, RVs, or ATVs used for personal purposes.  The deduction phases out by $200 for every $1,000 of modified AGI above $100 k ($200 k joint) and is unavailable to highly compensated employees, fleet purchases, leases, or foreign‑built vehicles.  Lenders must file new Form 1098‑PV reporting principal, interest, and vehicle data; Treasury must adjust withholding tables accordingly.",
    "impact": "• **Very costly and poorly targeted.** JCT’s preliminary estimate puts the four‑year static revenue loss at **$210 billion**; 58 % of the benefit flows to households with incomes above $100 k, while low‑income borrowers who buy used cars with cash or high‑rate subprime loans often exceed the $10 k cap or lack enough tax liability to benefit.\n• **Inflationary for vehicle prices.** Cox Automotive projects the measure would lift new‑car prices 2–3 % as dealers capture part of the subsidy in higher sticker prices—exacerbating affordability issues rather than solving them.\n• **Made‑in‑USA trade‑off.** Restricting the deduction to U.S.–assembled vehicles shuts out popular hybrids and EVs built abroad, potentially triggering WTO challenges and consumer confusion.\n• **Administrative overload.** Auto‑finance companies warn that creating and populating the new 6050AA reporting schema by January 2026 is “operationally impossible,” risking mismatched 1098‑PV data and a surge of IRS math‑error notices similar to early ACA Form 1095 roll‑outs.",

    "impact": "• **Take‑up problem remains.** GAO found only 307 companies claimed the credit in 2022—< 0.01 % of filers with payroll.  Increasing the percentage and cap may triple the revenue cost (≈ $6 billion/10 yrs) but will not reach most small firms that lack cash to build or contract on‑site care.  \n• **Highly regressive.** Credit subsidizes employees who already have stable jobs at mid‑to‑large firms; low‑wage parents in sectors without on‑site care (retail, gig) see no benefit.  Child‑care deserts—concentrated in rural counties—gain little because creditable spending presupposes available providers.  \n• **Supply‑side bottleneck.** Without parallel funding for workforce training and licensing, extra corporate dollars could bid up scarce slots and raise prices for non‑subsidized families.  \n• **Administrative complexity.** New rules for intermediaries and joint facilities require Treasury guidance; experts warn the IRS lacks childcare‑facility valuation expertise, increasing audit uncertainty.",

    "summary": "Revamps and extends §45S (set to expire 2025) by letting employers claim the credit either on direct wage payments or on insurance premiums for leave coverage; keeps the sliding‑scale ‘applicable percentage’ (12.5 %–25 %), tightens aggregation rules, requires policies cover part‑timers, and allows employers to elect a six‑month tenure threshold.",
    "impact": "• **Costlier yet still niche.** Treasury data show < 5,000 employers claimed the original credit in 2021.  Even with the insurance‑premium option, Urban Institute modeling suggests only 8 % of workers will be covered, while the ten‑year cost jumps to **$29 billion**.  \n• **Crowds out state programs.** Section 45S counts state‑mandated benefits toward minimum coverage but bans them from the credit calculation—creating a windfall for firms in no‑leave states and disadvantaging those already paying into state insurance pools.  \n• **Incentive mismatch.** Firms can buy bare‑bones private policies (high deductibles, carve‑outs) yet still claim the full credit, undermining leave adequacy goals.  Insurance carriers may market low‑value group plans that shift costs to employees.  \n• **Compliance maze.** New aggregation exceptions (“substantial and legitimate business reason”) invite disputes over who is the ‘employer’; IRS and DOL coordination problems plagued the first credit and will likely worsen with dual wage/premium paths.",

    "summary": "Makes up to **$5,000** of the §23 adoption credit refundable for tax years beginning after 2024 and restarts inflation indexing for all dollar thresholds using a 2001 base year (and 2024 for the new refundable tranche).  Refundable portion is not eligible for carry‑forward.",
    "impact": "• **Helps lower‑income adoptive parents, but only partially.** IRS data show roughly 40 % of adoptive families have insufficient tax liability to use the non‑refundable credit; making the first $5 k refundable covers average public‑agency adoption costs (~$2,900) but leaves private‑domestic and intercountry adopters (median cost $20‑45 k) still facing large out‑of‑pocket gaps.  \n• **Cost ≈ $7 billion/10 yrs.** JCT estimates each $1 k of refundability adds ~$1.4 billion over a decade; indexing the full credit to CPI adds a further $2 billion.  \n• **Complex eligibility maze persists.** Families must still navigate definitions of ‘special‑needs,’ foreign vs. domestic finalization timing, and income phase‑outs—rules GAO has called “error‑prone,” with a 21 % disallowance rate in the last major audit.  The refundable slice increases the incentive for questionable documentation unless IRS expands pre‑refund verification.  \n• **No administrative funding.** TIGTA has warned that processing refundable adoption claims requires manual review; absent extra IRS resources, refund delays are likely to rise beyond the current 4‑month average.",

    "summary": "Allows tribal governments, not just states, to certify that an adopted Native child has ‘special needs,’ making the family automatically eligible for the full adoption credit (including the refundable portion).  Applies starting in 2025.",
    "impact": "• **Closes a long‑criticized gap.** Under current law, Native children adopted under tribal court jurisdiction can lose automatic‑credit status because only state agencies may issue ‘special‑needs’ determinations; this fix aligns the credit with the Indian Child Welfare Act and could assist an estimated 2,000–3,000 adoptions annually.  \n• **Minimal fiscal cost (< $60 million/yr).** Even if every eligible family claims the full $18 ,500 indexed credit, the revenue impact is tiny relative to other provisions, but provides meaningful support to kinship caregivers in rural tribal areas.  \n• **Administrative challenges remain.** Many tribes lack dedicated child‑welfare staff; Treasury will need to coordinate with BIA to develop certification templates—without them, uptake may lag.  NICWA cautions that tribes must still meet complex IRS documentation rules, so technical‑assistance grants may be required to realize the benefit.",

    "summary": "Creates a new, four‑year, non‑refundable individual‑income‑tax credit (2026‑29) for cash or marketable‑securities donations to §501(c)(3) “scholarship‑granting organizations” (SGOs).  The credit equals the full donation but is capped at the greater of 10 % of AGI or $5,000 and limited by a national volume cap of **$5 billion per year** (inflation‑protected if > 90 % used).  Donations qualifying for a state tax credit must be netted out.  Eligible SGOs must prioritize low‑income students (≤ 300 % of area‑median income), meet audit and anti–self‑dealing rules, and distribute essentially all receipts within three years.  A parallel exclusion (§139J) makes SGO scholarships tax‑free to recipients.  New penalty rules (§4969) deny credit for contributions to SGOs that hoard funds, and explicit language bars federal or state regulators from imposing additional conditions on participating private or religious schools.",
    "impact": "• **Large revenue loss concentrated at the top.** Because donors can subtract state‑credit amounts first, Treasury’s dynamic scoring of a similar proposal (S.4416, 118th Cong.) estimated a ten‑year federal cost of **$90 billion**, with 80 % of the benefit flowing to households above $200 k AGI.  \n• **First‑come, first‑served national cap favors sophisticated filers.** Wealthy taxpayers with fast tax advisers are likely to grab the volume early each January; ordinary households may find the cap exhausted before they donate, replicating issues seen in high‑demand state programs like Arizona’s “Switcher” credit.  \n• **Oversight gaps invite abuse.** GAO and state auditors have documented SGO failures to verify income, self‑dealing with board members, and weak financial controls; the bill’s 100 % payout rule helps but IRS has limited capacity to review thousands of small nonprofits in real time.  \n• **Public‑school funding pressure.** Every donated dollar diverts potential state revenue and, under some formulas, reduces per‑pupil allocations.  Studies of statewide credits (e.g., Florida’s Tax‑Credit Scholarship) find mixed achievement gains but clear negative fiscal effects on district budgets.  \n• **Church‑state litigation risk.** The “no governmental control” clause forbids conditions beyond admissions nondiscrimination by disability status, potentially shielding schools that refuse LGBTQ+ students or teach sectarian curricula—an invitation for Establishment‑Clause challenges.",

    "summary": "Greatly expands the list of K‑12 costs that can be paid from 529 college‑savings plans—adding curricula, books, online materials, tutoring, dual‑enrollment fees, standardized‑test fees, and licensed disability therapies, including for home‑schoolers—so that tax‑free withdrawals can now cover most private‑school or homeschool expenses.",
    "impact": "• **Upside‑down subsidy.** GAO data show families with incomes above $200 k hold 70 % of 529 assets; extending tax‑free use to everyday K‑12 costs gives an outsized break to high‑income households while doing little for lower‑income families that lack spare cash to fund 529s.  \n• **Revenue drain.** JCT scored the far narrower 2017 K‑12 tuition expansion at $1.9 billion over ten years; adding books, tutoring, and homeschool expenses would likely push the cost above **$6 billion**, further eroding the federal college‑savings incentive.  \n• **Erodes college nest eggs.** Education‑finance researchers warn that tapping 529 balances for K‑12 costs will leave smaller funds for post‑secondary tuition, increasing student‑loan borrowing down the road.  \n• **Audit and compliance headaches.** State 529 administrators must police whether a tutor is “subject‑matter expert” or a therapy is “licensed,” tasks outside their expertise; Treasury would need new guidance, yet past GAO audits found weak oversight even for tuition‑only withdrawals.  \n• **Potential for abuse.** Homeschool supply vendors could market bundles as ‘529‑eligible,’ inviting aggressive interpretations (e.g., gaming consoles as ‘instructional materials’), increasing the risk of improper tax‑free withdrawals.",

    "summary": "Creates tax‑exempt “Trump accounts” for children under age 8, which may be **opened in 2025 but cannot receive contributions until 2026**.  Parents (and certain governments or charities) may then contribute up to **$5,000** per year (CPI‑indexed) into a custodial trust that invests only in low‑fee U.S.‑equity index funds.  Principal is always tax‑free; investment earnings are taxed at long‑term‑capital‑gains rates when withdrawn for qualified expenses (college, credentialing, first‑home purchase, or small‑business loans).  Non‑qualified withdrawals before age 30 incur ordinary income tax plus a 10 % penalty.  Duplicate accounts trigger excise taxes, and excess contributions face §4973 penalties.  A Treasury‑run program allows charities to mass‑fund accounts for groups of children.",
    "impact": "• **High cost, skewed toward wealthy families.** CRFB projects a ten‑year static revenue loss of **$54 billion**, nearly all flowing to households able to save $5 k annually per child; the lowest‑income quintile—who make < $1 k of annual deposits to 529s—would see negligible uptake.  \n• **Investment rigidity and market risk.** Limiting assets to un‑levered U.S. index funds may protect against gimmicky products but forces one‑size‑fits‑all portfolios; beneficiaries hitting age 18 after a market downturn could see half their expected balance wiped out.  \n• **Administrative complexity.** IRS must stand up new trustee reporting (Form 1099‑TA), a real‑time duplicate‑account registry, and a donor allocation platform—tasks reminiscent of advance CTC portals that faced security and accuracy problems.  \n• **Duplication of 529s and ESAs.** Policy analysts argue the proposal overlaps with existing 529 and Coverdell accounts, creating a patchwork of savings vehicles with different withdrawal rules and contribution caps, increasing taxpayer confusion.  \n• **Political branding issues.** Naming the accounts after a living individual is unprecedented in the tax code and could invite future partisan reversals, undermining long‑term planning confidence.",

    "summary": "Provides a **one‑time $1,000 federal deposit** into a Trump account for every U.S.‑citizen child **born from 2025 through 2028** whose parents supply valid SSNs. If no account exists at filing of the first return listing the child, Treasury must open one and choose a default low‑fee index‑fund trustee.  Parents may opt out, and penalties ($500 negligence / $1,000 fraud) apply to improper claims.",
    "impact": "• **Large up‑front outlay.** With roughly 3.6 million U.S. births a year, the credit would cost about **$14 billion over four years**, funded by new federal borrowing.  Unlike Baby Bonds proposals that target low‑income families, the deposit is universal and untargeted.  \n• **Administrative lift.** IRS and Treasury must build a birth‑match and account‑creation system by early 2026, reminiscent of the advance‑CTC portal that experienced verification backlogs; default‑trustee selection raises procurement and fiduciary‑duty questions.  \n• **Distributional neutrality—but ultimate regressivity.** Every newborn gets $1 k, yet higher‑income parents are more likely to add annual contributions and benefit from capital gains, widening wealth gaps by age 18.  \n• **Opt‑out complications.** Parents who miss or ignore Treasury notices may later discover an unwanted account; changing trustees or closing duplicate accounts triggers excise‑tax rules few households will understand.  \n• **Budget trade‑offs.** An unconditional baby bonus could fund 600,000 additional Head Start slots annually; critics argue the same money spent earlier on high‑quality childcare yields higher ROI than passive savings.",

    "summary": "Creates a new class of HRAs—called **Custom Health Option and Individual Care Expense (CHOICE) arrangements**—and deems them compliant with core ACA rules (no annual limits, preventive‑service coverage, etc.).  Like 2019’s ICHRAs, CHOICE HRAs reimburse employees for individual‑market premiums and out‑of‑pocket costs, but add explicit nondiscrimination rules letting employers offer the benefit to defined classes (full‑time, part‑time, geographic area, etc.) and impose age‑based dollar caps up to 3 × the lowest level.  Employers must furnish 60‑day advance notices, substantiate coverage, and report annual “permitted benefits” on Form W‑2.  Effective for plan years starting 2026.",
    "impact": "• **Risk‑pool segmentation.** Actuaries warn that small and mid‑size firms with healthier, younger workers are most likely to switch from traditional group plans to HRAs, leaving sicker workers in the fully insured small‑group market and nudging premiums upward by 3‑5 %.  \n• **Take‑up uncertainty.** ICHRAs, launched in 2020, cover only ~400,000 lives (< 0.3 % of ESI).  Without changes to employer mandates or a larger HRA tax subsidy, consultants expect CHOICE HRAs to attract a similar niche; Treasury revenue loss is modest (~$2 billion/10 yrs).  \n• **Compliance burden.** Employers must track employee‑class definitions, age‑based caps, and substantiation of individual‑market enrollment; smaller firms will likely outsource to vendors, adding administrative costs that could offset premium flexibility.  \n• **Coordination with subsidies.** Employees offered a CHOICE HRA remain ineligible for marketplace premium tax credits unless the employer allowance is ‘unaffordable’; awareness is low, and past GAO audits show many ICHRA participants inadvertently forgo the more valuable PTC.  \n• **Potential for gaming.** The ability to offer traditional small‑group coverage to the same class if subject to ACA rating rules creates incentives to carve out sub‑classes and shift higher‑risk employees toward the exchange, testing the nondiscrimination guardrails.",

    "impact": "• **Tax‑base erosion.** CBO estimates pretax premium conversion will reduce payroll and income‑tax revenue by **$18 billion over ten years** if CHOICE HRA adoption scales to 3 million employees; Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds take proportional hits.  \n• **Further tilts market.** Pretax treatment makes employer‑linked exchange enrolment more attractive, amplifying incentives for firms to migrate to HRAs and potentially accelerating risk‑pool splits described above.  \n• **Administrative complexity for exchanges.** State marketplaces must adapt eligibility calculations to account for pretax employee contributions and HRA affordability rules—an IT lift similar to the recent “family glitch” fix that took two years to implement.  \n• **Equity concerns.** Non‑HRA individual‑market purchasers (gig workers, early retirees) still pay with after‑tax dollars unless they qualify for PTCs, widening disparities between otherwise identical consumers.",

Also clarifies that post‑65 HSA funds may be used to buy Medicare premiums only for non‑eligible individuals.",
    "impact": "• **Revenue loss of ~ $13 billion/10 yrs** (JCT estimate) as higher‑income working seniors shelter wages from payroll and income tax.  \n• **Equity tilt.** Only 22 % of seniors remain in the labor force; of those, half work for employers offering HDHPs.  Low‑income retirees on full Medicare gain nothing.  \n• **Complex coordination.** Seniors juggling HSAs, Part A/B, and employer coverage face new pitfalls; SSA already warns of retrospective Part A enrollment that retroactively disqualifies prior HSA contributions, now further complicated.  \n• **Incentive to delay Social Security.** Some near‑retirees could postpone claiming benefits (and thus Part A enrollment) to maximize pre‑tax HSA space, affecting OASI cash‑flow forecasts.",

    "impact": "• **Concierge‑care subsidy.** DPC memberships skew toward higher‑income patients; a 2023 Milliman survey found median annual fees of $1,800.

    "summary": "Allows individuals to treat up to **$500 per year** ($1,000 joint/HoH) in ‘qualified sports and fitness expenses’—fitness‑club dues, group exercise classes, team‑sports fees—as §223(d)(2)(A) medical expenses payable or reimbursable from HSAs, FSAs, or HRAs.  Single‑visit passes, personal trainers, remote videos, golf/hunting/sailing/riding facilities, and luxury retreats are excluded.  Dollar caps are CPI‑indexed after 2026 and subject to a pro‑rated monthly limit.",
    "impact": "• **Tax break skews toward higher earners.** Only 1 in 5 low‑income workers contribute to HSAs/FSAs versus 70 % of households above $100 k; thus most benefits flow to affluent gym members, while the uninsured receive none.  \n• **Revenue loss ≈ $4 billion/10 yrs.** CRS modeling of the 2018 PHIT Act (which proposed the same $1k limit) put static cost at $3.5 billion; indexing and broader FSA/HRA use raise the figure slightly.  \n• **Limited public‑health impact.** Evidence from Canada’s fitness‑tax‑credit experiment shows negligible increases in activity but a 90 % windfall to people who would have exercised anyway.  \n• **Administrative complexity.** Employers and plan administrators must verify that dues meet the statute’s precise facility definition and that monthly caps aren’t exceeded across multiple accounts—tasks likely to increase FSA/HSA substantiation costs.  \n• **Policy precedent creep.** Opens the door for lobbying to add boutique wellness services (e.g., meditation apps, nutrition programs) as ‘medical’, further eroding the tax base.",

    "summary": "Allows workers who have not been in an HDHP for **four prior years** to roll over FSA or HRA balances (up to the current FSA salary‑reduction cap—$3,200 in 2026 est.) into an HSA when they newly elect HDHP coverage.  Post‑transfer, the FSA/HRA must convert to HSA‑compatible status for the rest of the plan year.  The rollover reduces that year’s regular HSA contribution by only the growth in the FSA/HRA balance during the pre‑transfer months.  Employers must report the transfer on Form W‑2.",
    "impact": "• **Reduces forfeitures, but at a cost.** EBRI projects $11 billion currently ‘use‑it‑or‑lose‑it’ in FSAs; letting balances flow to HSAs shifts that money from taxable spend to tax‑free savings, producing a **$6‑7 billion revenue loss over ten years**.  \n• **Favours higher earners.** Median FSA balance is $500; high‑income employees with maxed‑out accounts capture the bulk of the tax windfall.  \n• **Potential gaming.** Workers could front‑load elective deferrals, switch to HDHP mid‑year, and roll cash into an HSA—Treasury must police the four‑year HDHP‑gap rule and growth‑only offset to curb abuse.  \n• **Employer burden.** Plan administrators must track mid‑year balance changes and lock the FSA/HRA into limited‑purpose status—tasks that third‑party vendors will charge for, raising overhead for small businesses.",
