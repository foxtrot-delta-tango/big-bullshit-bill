    "summary": "Rescinds all unobligated balances for nine Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) energy-related accounts, including DOE’s Home Energy Contractor Training program, multiple Loan Programs Office (LPO) authorities (Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing, Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment, Tribal Energy Loan Guarantees, Transmission Facility Financing), the Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program, and several electric-transmission grant/analysis programs.  The money that has not yet been contractually committed is clawed back to the Treasury.",
    "impact": "•  Eliminates up to **$30 billion** in still-unobligated IRA spending authority, sharply curtailing DOE’s ability to subsidize clean-energy manufacturing, large-scale transmission, and industrial-decarbonization projects.  \n•  Projects that were preparing to apply for LPO or transmission grants must now seek private or other federal financing.  \n•  Supporters argue the rescissions reduce deficit spending and focus DOE on core missions; critics say they undercut job creation and climate goals, especially in rural and tribal areas.",

NATURAL GAS EXPORTS AND IMPORTS.\r\n\r\n    Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b) is amended by \r\nadding at the end the following:\r\n    ``(g) Charge for Exportation or Importation of Natural Gas.--The \r\nSecretary of Energy shall, by rule, impose and collect, for each \r\napplication to export natural gas from the United States to a foreign \r\ncountry with which there is not in effect a free trade agreement \r\nrequiring national treatment for trade in natural gas, or to import \r\nnatural gas from such a foreign country, a nonrefundable charge of \r\n$1,000,000, and, for purposes of subsection (a), the importation or \r\nexportation of natural gas that is proposed in an application for which \r\nsuch a nonrefundable charge was imposed and collected shall be deemed \r\nto be in the public interest, and such an application shall be granted \r\nwithout modification or delay.''.",
    "summary": "Adds a new subsection to §3 of the Natural Gas Act requiring DOE to levy a **$1 million non-refundable fee** on each application to export or import natural gas to or from a country without a U.S. free-trade agreement.  Upon payment, the application is statutorily deemed \"in the public interest\" and must be approved without modification or delay.",
    "impact": "•  Shifts DOE’s discretionary public-interest review for non-FTA LNG authorizations to a pay-for-permit model, likely shortening review times but raising entry costs for smaller exporters or importers.  \n•  Could accelerate LNG export capacity builds, potentially increasing domestic gas prices and global greenhouse-gas emissions.  \n•  Generates new offsetting receipts to the Treasury, but may provoke legal challenges over delegation of environmental-review duties.",

and\r\n                    (B) that revokes such approval or permit or \r\n                cancels, delays, or renders unviable the covered energy \r\n                project regardless of whether the regulation, \r\n                administrative decision, or executive action is \r\n                responsive to a court order.\r\n            (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \r\n        of Energy.\r\n            (6) Sponsor.--The term ``sponsor'' means an entity \r\n        incorporated and headquartered in the United States with an \r\n        ownership or development interest in a covered energy project.\r\n            (7) Sponsor capital contribution.--The term ``sponsor \r\n        capital contribution'' means the projected capital expenditure \r\n        of a sponsor for a covered energy project, as certified by the \r\n        Secretary at the time of enrollment in the program, which shall \r\n        include verifiable development, construction, permitting, and \r\n        financing costs directly related to the covered energy project.",
    "summary": "Appropriates **$10 million** to launch a DOE fund that reimburses U.S. sponsors of large fossil-fuel or nuclear projects (≥ $30 million) for unrecoverable losses if a subsequent federal action cancels or makes the project unviable.  Sponsors pay a 5 % enrollment fee plus annual premiums (1.5 % of their capital contribution) into a De-Risking Compensation Fund, from which DOE can pay claims up to the sponsor’s investment, subject to fund solvency and a 2034 sunset.",
    "impact": "•  Socializes certain regulatory risks, encouraging private capital for carbon-intensive energy projects by offering insurance against future federal reversals.  \n•  Critics say it shifts environmental-compliance costs to taxpayers and could incentivize speculative projects; proponents argue it counters policy unpredictability that deters infrastructure investment.  \n•  Because payouts cannot exceed premium collections plus the $10 million seed, fiscal exposure is capped but the program’s effectiveness may be limited.",

    "impact": "•  Reverses years of congressionally scheduled SPR sell-offs, aiming to restore inventory toward the 714-million-barrel design capacity after emergency releases in 2022-23.  \n•  Provides dedicated capital for long-deferred cavern leaching, pump upgrades, and security, improving readiness for supply emergencies.  \n•  Purchasing oil adds upward pressure on demand but may be timed for price dips; repeal of mandatory sales removes roughly **140 million barrels** of future budget-driven disposals.",
