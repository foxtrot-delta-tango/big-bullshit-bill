    "summary": "Establishes a **risk-sharing framework**—starting award year 2028-29—under which every Title IV institution must reimburse the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for a portion of new Direct Loans that are **not repaid** by each annual “student cohort.”  Key mechanics:\n• **Cohort creation** – Three buckets per year: (1) completers (by program), (2) under-grad non-completers (institution-wide) and (3) grad non-completers (by program).\n• **Reimbursement percentage** – For completers, a sliding scale equals 100 % × (1 – median value-added earnings ÷ median total price). If earnings < 0, liability = 100 %; if earnings > price, liability = 0 %. For non-completers, liability equals the institutional non-completion rate (under-grad) or program-specific non-completion rate (grad).\n• **Non-repayment balance** – Annual shortfall between scheduled and actual payments **plus** any interest subsidies or forgiveness amounts; special rules for consolidations and dual completers.\n• **Penalties** – Late payments accrue interest after 90 days; after 12, 18 or 24 months of delinquency the program, institution or all Title IV eligibility is progressively suspended—up to a 10-year ban.\n• **Off-ramp** – Schools may halve liabilities by voluntarily exiting the federal loan program for a given credential for at least ten years.\n• **Use of funds** – All reimbursements are sequestered for the new PROMISE Grant program (§ 30042).",
    "impact": "• **Cost-sharing shift** – CBO preliminary score: ≈ $9–11 B in institutional payments over 10 years—redirected to fund need-based grants.\n• **Behavioral incentives** – Encourages colleges to curb prices, restrict borrowing in low-ROI programs, boost completion, or improve labor-market alignment; could also spur program closures—especially at for-profits and small privates with poor outcomes.\n• **Equity concerns** – High open-access institutions with greater numbers of Pell recipients and non-traditional students may face the largest liabilities despite serving riskier populations.\n• **Administrative complexity** – ED must build new data systems connecting earnings, repayment and pricing; similar to Gainful Employment but across all sectors.\n• **Legal/Policy debate** – Mirrors “skin-in-the-game” proposals (e.g., Alexander-Bennet Risk-Sharing Act; GAO-19-103), likely to trigger litigation and lobbying over cohort definitions and geographic earnings adjustments.",

    "summary": "Creates **PROMISE Grants** (Promoting Real Opportunities to Maximize Investments and Savings in Education) to reward institutions that offer affordable degrees and strong earnings outcomes.  Funded entirely with § 30041 reimbursements (and unused Title IV refunds), grants begin in award year 2028-29 and last 6 years per award.\n**Eligibility & Guarantees**\n• Must be a Title IV institution (excluding for-profits) that publishes—one year in advance—a **Maximum Total Price for Completion** by income/SAI band and guarantees that figure to each new aid recipient for at least the typical time-to-degree (up to 6 years).\n• Failure to honor the guarantee would violate program terms (subject to ED enforcement).\n**Grant formula**\nGrant = min( (‹VA-earnings/Total-Price›-1)×Avg-Pell × Low-Income Completion rate , $5 000 × Avg Aid Recipients ), capped proportionally if funds run short.\n**Use of funds** – Flexible: expand affordability initiatives, boost outreach, support completion, align curricula with in-demand fields, evaluate & share best practices.\n**Definitions** – Introduces ‘value-added earnings’ (earnings above 150 % or 300 % of poverty, geo-adjusted) and lays out earnings-measurement periods (1–4 yrs post-completion, extendable for licensure residencies).  ED must publish transparency metrics.\n**Reserve mechanics** – If annual reimbursements are insufficient, ED may tap returned Title IV funds; if still short, grant amounts are prorated across recipients.",
    "impact": "• **Positive incentives** – Shifts federal campus-based aid from historical inputs (SEOG/FWS) toward measurable value and price restraint; potential windfalls for high-performing regional publics and community colleges.\n• **Student‐level transparency** – Requires early disclosure of holistic ‘sticker-to-degree’ cost, easing planning and reducing borrowing surprises.\n• **Redistribution effects** – For-profit and pricey private nonprofits are excluded; funds flow toward institutions with high Pell volume and strong earnings-to-price ratios, potentially amplifying stratification.\n• **Administrative burden** – Schools must calculate and publish Maximum Total Prices by income & SAI band, track fulfillment, and report completion/value metrics—necessitating upgraded IR and financial-aid systems.\n• **Fiscal neutrality** – Because PROMISE relies on recovered funds, net mandatory spending is projected as budget-neutral after FY 2030, though initial outlays depend on timing of reimbursements vs grant obligations.",
