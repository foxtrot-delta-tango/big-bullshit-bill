    "summary": "Directs OPM to create a rigorous, document‑based verification system for adding dependents to FEHB, conduct a five‑year audit of all existing family‑member enrollments, disenroll ineligible dependents, and ramps up dedicated oversight funding ($36 – 60 M annually plus $80 M one‑time audit money).",
    "impact": "• **Savings potential, but evidence thin.** GAO estimates ineligible dependents may cost FEHB up to $1 billion a year, yet prior OPM pilot verifications captured only ~2 % of dependents; mandatory audits could recoup far less than projected while costing hundreds of millions to administer. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}\n\n• **Administrative drag on agencies.** HR offices would shoulder new paperwork burdens during open seasons and life‑event changes, diverting staff from mission work; smaller agencies with thin HR capacity could struggle to meet record‑retention rules. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}\n\n• **Privacy & equity risks.** Retaining sensitive documents for six years after coverage ends enlarges the attack surface for identity theft; same‑sex couples, adoptive parents, and guardians may face disproportionate hurdles proving eligibility.\n\n• **Funding carve‑out precedent.** Permanently exempting OPM oversight dollars from congressional spending caps reduces future fiscal flexibility and creates a quasi‑entitlement for compliance contractors.",
