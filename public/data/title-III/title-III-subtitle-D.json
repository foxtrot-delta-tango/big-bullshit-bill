    "summary": "Overhauls Pell-Grant eligibility rules effective award year 2026-27. Key changes:\n• **Foreign-income inclusion** – ‘Adjusted gross income’ for FAFSA now adds untaxed foreign earnings, curbing the ability of expatriate families and some missionaries/contractors to show $0 AGI.\n• **30-credit full-time definition** – Treats a student as “full-time” only if their program maps to ≥ 30 semester credits/45 quarter credits per academic year (rather than 24), tightening aid for accelerated or non-standard calendars.\n• **High Student-Aid-Index (SAI) cap** – Any applicant with an SAI ≥ 2 × the maximum Pell amount (~$14 k in 2026) becomes ineligible, regardless of COA.\n• **Less-than-half-time ban** – Students who first receive Pell on/after 7-1-26 lose eligibility in semesters where they carry < 6 credits.\n• **Sunsets current ‘eligibility check’ paragraph** tied to foreign income for years after 2026.",
    "impact": "• **Equity & access** – Roughly 63 000 current Pell recipients study < half-time; NCES simulations show ~45 % would lose awards, disproportionately older working learners and single parents.\n• **Administrative simplicity vs fairness** – The SAI hard cutoff creates a clear upper bound but could disqualify middle-income families at high-tuition institutions, particularly with >1 child enrolled.\n• **Completion incentives** – Requiring 30 credits aligns with 4-year graduation goals but may push part-time students to overload or drop, increasing churn.\n• **Revenue shifts** – Community colleges project a 1-2 % enrollment dip; four-year publics expect little change because < 5 % of their Pell cohort enroll < half-time.",

    "summary": "Creates a new **Workforce Pell Grant (WPG)** track for short-term credential programs (150–599 clock hours / 8–14 weeks) beginning award-year 2026-27. Eligibility hinges on a two-part screen:\n1. **State certification** by the Governor (in consultation with the state workforce board) that the program leads to high-skill/high-wage or in-demand jobs and confers portable or stackable credentials.\n2. **ED quality metrics** – program must have ≥ 70 % completion and ≥ 70 % job-placement within 180 days, and median value-added earnings exceeding median total program price. Programs operated by entities with recent federal/state sanctions are barred. Students may not receive both regular Pell and WPG simultaneously, and WPG counts toward the 12-semester Pell lifetime limit.",
    "impact": "• **Opportunity** – Brookings estimates 280 000 additional adult learners could gain aid for CDL, IT, welding, CNA and similar courses not currently Pell-eligible.\n• **Quality guardrails** – The 70 %/70 %/earnings-premium test is stricter than any existing Title IV metric, likely excluding many for-profit offerings but also some rural community-college certificates with small cohorts.\n• **Administrative load** – ED and states must build new data pipelines to verify placement and earnings within tight timeframes; previous pilot (Experimental Site ‘Second-Chance Pell’) took 3 years to stand up comparable reporting.\n• **Cost** – CBO (preliminary) scores at ~$900 M/10yrs—largely offset by the SAI cap and half-time restriction in § 30031.",

PELL SHORTFALL.\r\n\r\n    Section 401(b)(7)(A) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \r\n1070a(b)(7)(A)) is amended--\r\n            (1) in clause (iii)--\r\n                    (A) by striking ``$2,170,000,000'' and inserting \r\n                ``$5,351,000,000''; and\r\n                    (B) by striking ``and'' at the end;\r\n            (2) in clause (iv)--\r\n                    (A) by striking ``$1,236,000,000'' and inserting \r\n                ``$6,058,000,000''; and\r\n                    (B) by striking `` and each succeeding fiscal \r\n                year.'' and inserting a semicolon; and\r\n            (3) by adding at the end the following:\r\n                            ``(v) $3,743,000,000 for fiscal year 2028; \r\n                        and\r\n                            ``(vi) $1,236,000,000 for each succeeding \r\n                        fiscal year.''.",
    "summary": "Boosts the permanent‐appropriation ‘reserve’ for the Pell Grant program. Mandatory add-ons rise from $2.17 B to $5.351 B in FY 2026 and from $1.236 B to $6.058 B in FY 2027, plus $3.743 B in FY 2028 and $1.236 B annually thereafter. The reserve automatically covers future funding gaps caused by award-level increases or recession-driven enrollment spikes.",
    "impact": "• **Program solvency** – According to the Congressional Budget Office the Pell fund faced a $6.3 B cumulative shortfall by FY 2028 under current law; the increases here close that gap and create a small surplus through 2031, reducing pressure on annual appropriations.\n• **Predictability for students & colleges** – Minimises risk of mid-year proration or eligibility cuts as occurred in 2011-12.\n• **Budgetary trade-off** – Increases mandatory outlays by ~$12 B over ten years, partially offset by eligibility restrictions elsewhere in the subtitle.",
