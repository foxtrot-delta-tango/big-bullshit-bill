    "summary": "Cancels every unspent dollar that the Inflation Reduction Act (§ 40001, P.L. 117‑169) appropriated to NOAA for coastal resilience grants, habitat restoration, and climate‑hazard mitigation.",
    "impact": "• **Coastal risk rises.**  The IRA tranche targeted flood‑control dunes, living‑shoreline projects, and early‑warning systems; pulling the plug shifts billions in local match commitments onto states or terminates projects mid‑stream, increasing exposure to storm‑surge and sea‑level rise.\n• **Whiplash for grantees.**  More than 100 announced awards are still finalising agreements; abrupt rescission invites breach‑of‑contract suits and erodes trust in future federal cost‑share programs.\n• **Budget optics vs. disaster costs.**  Treasury savings (~$2.6 bn unobligated) are likely dwarfed by future FEMA disaster outlays that resilience projects were designed to avoid.\n• **Scientific setback.**  NOAA’s new community climate‑service hubs, slated for these funds, are likely shelved, limiting local access to high‑resolution sea‑level projections.",

    "impact": "• **Dilutes U.S. weather‑prediction competitiveness.**  Lab renovations and super‑computing upgrades now unfunded could slow rollout of hurricane and wildfire forecast improvements promised for 2028.\n• **Tourism & local‑economy hit.**  Sanctuary visitor‑center overhauls (e.g., Florida Keys, Monterey Bay) are likely cancelled—foregoing construction jobs and future fee revenue.\n• **Asset‑management gap.**  NOAA’s deferred‑maintenance backlog already tops $800 million; rescission deepens it, raising long‑term costs as facilities age.\n• **Marginal deficit gain.**  Savings (≈$1 bn unobligated) are tiny compared with NOAA’s annual disaster‑damage assessments that better observations could mitigate.",

    "impact": "• **Subsidy revival.**  Waiving repayment and cost‑sharing re‑creates pre‑1982 reclamation subsidies, effectively gifting large western irrigation districts and power users new capacity without local financial stake.\n• **Environmental litigation magnet.**  Enlarging dams often triggers ESA, NEPA and tribal water‑right conflicts; the bill provides no streamlining, risking decade‑long court fights that idle the $2 bn.\n• **Climate‑resilience trade‑off.**  Money flows exclusively to more storage rather than demand‑side conservation or groundwater recharge, conflicting with modern water‑management science that emphasises portfolio approaches.\n• **Opportunity cost.**  Non‑reimbursable outlays crowd out revenue‑generating investments (e.g., pumped hydro) and reduce reclaimable receipts to the Treasury.",

    "impact": "• **Fixes leaks, but skews incentives.**  Restoring capacity in century‑old canals (e.g., Central Valley Project) can save water, yet 0 % cost‑share dulls incentives for districts to curb conveyance losses on their own dime.\n• **Potential ESA fast‑track conflicts.**  Canal‑lining projects can dewater riparian habitat; without explicit environmental guardrails, funds may meet legal roadblocks similar to past Friant‑Kern litigation.\n• **Equity questions.**  Concentrates benefits in western irrigation districts while Tribes and small rural water systems—often lacking conveyance at all—receive no direct support.\n• **Budgetary precedent.**  Setting storage *and* conveyance at full federal cost could spark parallel demands from Army Corps, raising future outlay expectations.",
